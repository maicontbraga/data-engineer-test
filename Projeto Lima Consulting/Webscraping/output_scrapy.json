NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!\n   It doesn\u2019t happen often, but about a week ago there was a tweet that made my day.  Jeff Bezos , one of the richest men in the world, posted a picture of himself finishing a Big Mac and fries with the caption \"My first job. And still the same great burger. Happy Sunday!\" That\u2019s right \u2013 the man who founded Amazon and created the most incredible distribution system in human history, got his start with a minimum wage job at McDonald\u2019s. Just as impressive, despite the fact that his tremendous wealth means he can have any meal he desires, he sometimes still prefers a classic American burger and fries that virtually any American can afford.\u00a0 In three short sentences, it was a tweet about so many things that make American exceptional. It was about opportunity and a path from the working class to, well, anywhere your ambition may take you. It was about a dream \u2013 the American Dream \u2013 that actually can come true.\u00a0 MCDONALD'S USA PRESIDENT JOE ERLINGER CRITICIZES CALIFORNIA FAST-FOOD WORKERS BILL Of course, the usual suspects on the Left attacked Mr. Bezos for the tweet. But their attacks can\u2019t change the facts. A  minimum wage McDonald\u2019s job  is where he started \u2013 and Amazon is where he ended up. Any sane person would respect that.\u00a0     \n      FILE \u2013 McDonald's restaurant\n       (iStock) Just as impressively, it said something very positive about American business. McDonald\u2019s, a small restaurant started by two brothers in Riverside, California, became  a worldwide icon  because it has products people want \u2013 regardless of their wealth \u2013 at a price virtually anyone can afford \u2013 regardless of their income. What a concept! The success of that venture created opportunity for millions of individuals who got their start at a quick service restaurant, Mr. Bezos being but one shining example. Personally, while not nearly as successful as Mr. Bezos, I got my minimum wage start at a Baskin & Robbins in Chagrin Falls, Ohio \u2013 and went on to live the American Dream. Perhaps that\u2019s why I found the Bezos tweet so uplifting.\u00a0 FAST-FOOD FRANCHISEES SAY CALIFORNIA'S AB 257 COULD INCREASE COSTS, UNDERMINE BUSINESS MODEL Unfortunately, it took the progressive geniuses running the state of California literally a day to bring that optimism crashing down. Literally on the following day,  California lawmakers  passed legislation titled the Fast Food Accountability and Standards Recovery Act (\"FAST\") raising the state\u2019s minimum wage from an already generous $15 and hour to $22 for quick service restaurant employees. Adding to California\u2019s growing image as a dystopian state, the legislation would also create a new state commission with authority to determine not only those workers\u2019 wages but also their hours and working conditions.\u00a0 The irony is that this legislation would hurt the very people it is being sold as protecting.\u00a0 Most workers make more than their state\u2019s minimum wage and those who do earn it are likely to be low skilled/entry level teenagers or young adults working part-time. Nationally, restaurant workers' hourly wages average about  $18.50  an hour, likely higher in California with its minimum wage already at $15. So, what are the risks of further increasing it? \u00a0\u00a0 CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER Restaurants are already battling to recover from  California\u2019s severe pandemic lockdowns  while keeping prices down in the face of inflation that is simultaneously driving labor and commodity costs to unprecedented highs \u2013 and at rates not seen in 40 years. If you add additional labor costs on top of these already crippling cost increases, few new restaurants are likely to open, and many are likely to close, as leases expire, or entrepreneurs simply give up and move to Texas, Florida, or Tennessee? Restaurants that do stay open will need to find ways to cut labor with automation being a key component, \u00a0including ordering kiosks and machines that actually make burgers without the human touch. \u00a0With fewer restaurants opening, many closing and those that stay open struggling to cut labor, those opportunity creating jobs that millions of individuals, including Mr. Bezos and I, relied on to get our starts will vanish like electricity and water in a California summer. Sadly, for young Californians, that\u2019s opportunity lost and never to be recovered. \u00a0     \n      FILE \u2013 California Gov. Gavin Newsom speaks during a news conference after meeting with students at James Denman Middle School on October 01, 2021 in San Francisco, California.\u00a0\n       (Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) How about those delicious and affordable burgers and fries? They, too, will be a thing of the past as the few surviving restaurants will dramatically increase prices to offset ever increasing labor costs. Mr. Bezos will still be able to afford his Big Mac (and me my  Carl\u2019s Jr. Western Bacon Cheeseburger ). But for many Californians, those items will no longer be affordable. \u00a0 These results are far from difficult to predict. In a recent  survey  of economists by the Employment Policy Institute, a strong majority (83%) opposed adopting this law; 93% believed the cost of operating a franchise would increase; 84% believed fewer restaurant chains would be willing to operate in California; 84% believed consumers prices would increase as business owners pass on higher costs; and 73% believed franchisees would close restaurants. It\u2019s really not rocket science.\u00a0 CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Let\u2019s hope  California Gov. Gavin Newsom , who once owned a restaurant or two, will see the dangers of this FAST legislation, and decline to sign it. The deadline is September 30th. \u00a0But the unions and other progressive groups supporting this government overreach supported Newsom in his recent recall fight.\u00a0 Failing to support their efforts would take a level of political courage rarely seen in the formerly Golden State.

NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!\n   America is in the midst of the  worst worker shortage in recent memory. \u00a0 Many have heard the stories of employers offering bonuses and higher salaries in a desperate effort to fill openings.\u00a0 Many have experienced delays at restaurants or stores that are short-staffed. Others have had their flights delayed or canceled because there are not enough baggage handlers, TSA agents, pilots, or flight attendants.\u00a0 \u00a0 Indeed, the scope of this labor shortage is unprecedented. Data from the St. Louis Federal Reserve indicates that 2022 has seen the highest number of job openings on record. Moreover, the labor force participation rate remains a full percentage point below its pre-COVID-19 levels, translating to more than two million fewer workers in the economy today. MOST ACCOMPLISHED DRIVERS SPOTLIGHTED BY UBER IN FIRST-EVER \u2018YEARBOOK\u2019 This is a problem that deserves our attention.

(Matthew Hatcher/Bloomberg via Getty Images}\n       While there is no silver bullet, there are a handful of steps that Congress, local governments, and this administration can take right now to help bolster the workforce and give our economy a much-needed boost.\u00a0 First, our country needs to address the growing mismatch between the skills needed to fill openings and the skills jobseekers possess. The skills gap, as this phenomenon has come to be called, is  especially prevalent for technical jobs  requiring more than a high school diploma but less than a four-year bachelor\u2019s degree \u2014\u00a0think software programmers, hospital technicians, HVAC specialists, and so on. \u00a0 These are generally well-paying jobs that offer solid benefits, and the skills they require can be obtained through workforce training programs at local community colleges and technical schools. We should make these programs more accessible to Americans interested in taking advantage of them. \u00a0 One proposal from Senators  Rob Portman, R-OH, and Tim Kaine, D-VA, will do just that. Their bill, The JOBS Act, would allow Pell Grants to be used at technical schools and community colleges, enabling countless Americans to receive the training they need to fill in-demand jobs that help fuel our economy. Congress should pass this legislation without delay.\u00a0   Video Second, Medicaid work requirements should be considered for able-bodied adults without dependents. Medicaid was created nearly 60 years ago to provide free or heavily subsidized health care coverage to impoverished women and children, disabled individuals, and seniors in nursing homes who cannot afford the cost of long-term care. In 2010,\u00a0Obamacare expanded Medicaid eligibility to healthy, working-age adults living at or slightly above the poverty line. Since then, Medicaid enrollment has ballooned to more than 75 million.\u00a0\u00a0 With over 10 million unfilled jobs, non-elderly, non-disabled adult Medicaid recipients can be required to work, search for work, or pursue educational opportunities in exchange for their taxpayer-funded benefits. This would help get more than a million Americans into the workforce and on a path toward self-sufficiency.\u00a0\u00a0 CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER Third, local and state-level legislative bodies should take a hard look at reducing or eliminating burdensome and unnecessary occupational licensing requirements that don\u2019t genuinely further public safety. Roughly a third of American workers are required to obtain a government license to legally offer goods or services for pay, and individual states control these regulations.\u00a0While licensing makes sense for doctors and pilots, there seems little reason to force florists, interior designers, cosmetologists, and tour guides to pay hundreds or thousands of dollars and complete extensive educational programs as a prerequisite for work. Indeed, many of these occupational licensing requirements in effect today have become barriers to entry that curtail competition.\u00a0\u00a0 America is home to one of the most productive, innovative, and resourceful workforce in the world.

It is also appealing to be on your own out here, with no one looking over your shoulder \u2014 being independent and being your own boss.\" Being a trucker has its challenges, too. \"I have always said it takes a strong and special person to be a truck driver\u2019s spouse, and I am lucky enough to have one of those.\"   \"The job is not without its hardships,\" said Miller. \"Long hours every day, for weeks at a time and longer.

California is a wonderful, wonderful state and the people are really terrific. It's the government that's the problem in California.

NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!\n   President Joe Biden is reportedly still haggling with Washington Democrats to revive some version of the legislative Frankenstein that is their $5-trillion Build Back Broke agenda. Having failed thus far to convince his own party to support his policies, Biden is finding new ways to rewrite America\u2019s laws through executive actions, spending more than half a trillion worth of tax dollars in the process.\u00a0 These executive actions have become so common place in the  Biden administration  \u2014\u00a0with 530 undertaken so far \u2013 and the implications for taxpayers so glaring, that I asked the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) to\u00a0determine the cost\u00a0of Biden\u2019s eight most expensive executive actions. The results are stunning: in just 16 months, Joe Biden has charged American taxpayers $532 billion \u2014\u00a0all with no input from the American people themselves or a vote by their elected representatives in Congress. \u00a0     \n      FILE \u2013 First lady Jill Biden listens as President Biden talks to reporters before boarding Marine One on the South Lawn of the White House, Friday, June 17, 2022, in Washington.

Take for example his decision to stop President Trump\u2019s public charge rule. At a time when America is facing the worst border crisis in at least two decades \u2014 perhaps ever \u2014\u00a0Biden\u2019s decision to abandon the public charge rule means that more welfare dollars and benefits will flow to immigrants. How much?

President Biden\u2019s  decision to extend the moratorium on student loan repayments overwhelmingly benefits the fewer than 40 percent of Americans who went to college and have higher lifetime earnings at the expense of the 60 percent who did not.\u00a0 This pause on loan repayment has cost taxpayers nearly $100 billion so far and is a gross attack on working families who are being forced to bail out the wealthiest 20% of earners who hold nearly one-third of student loan debt. It will further add to America\u2019s inflation crisis; and it is in addition to the $3 billion the president spent by outright and unilaterally canceling the student loan debts of 40,000 borrowers.\u00a0 The president is even now considering spending roughly another $230 billion \u2014by canceling $10,000 of student debt for households making up to $300,000. Not only does this fail to address the high prices American families are facing because of inflation, but it is a shameful political ploy and a clear overreach of the president\u2019s executive authority in order to protect the Democrats\u2019 wealthy base.\u00a0   Video Biden\u2019s actions are not only expensive, they are damaging to the American economy and American workers. The president talks about how few Americans are looking for jobs, touting low unemployment numbers. But rarely, if ever, does he talk about how many businesses are looking for workers. There are currently 11.3 million job openings in our country. Much of this labor shortage is the result of the president\u2019s reckless executive actions and economic policies that expanded welfare programs \u2014\u00a0in one instance at a cost of $300 billion in expanded benefits \u2014\u00a0while gutting work requirements, which kept able-bodied workers sidelined and forced businesses to shut down. Telling able-bodied workers they do not have to look for employment will cost the American taxpayer an estimated $14 billion.\u00a0 While American families are projected to spend over $5,000 more this year because of the president\u2019s  inflation crisis , Biden is busy issuing executive orders that will add hundreds of billions to the taxpayer\u2019s tab and enact sweeping policies that expand Washington command and control over Americans' lives \u2014\u00a0without Congress ever authorizing those actions or appropriating that spending. All the while, the president is trying to perpetuate a myth that\u00a0he is reducing the deficit.\u00a0   Video CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER During a recent congressional hearing, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen testified that fiscal restraint plays a vital role in reducing inflation. Biden has openly admitted that  deficit reduction is necessary  to curb the rise in prices. Yet, the president\u2019s track record tells a different story. Biden has repeatedly used his executive authority to massively increase government spending and expand Washington\u2019s regulatory footprint.\u00a0 At the start of his administration,  President Donald Trump  implemented a \"one-in, two-out\" approach to regulations. Meaning that for every new regulation proposed by an agency, two had to be repealed. By the end of 2020, the Trump Administration had eliminated eight regulations for every new regulation adopted. These actions reduced the direct cost of regulatory compliance by $50 billion and were projected to reduce costs by an additional $50 billion in FY 2020 alone, providing the average American household with an extra $3,100 every year, according to some estimates.\u00a0 CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Biden\u2019s decision to reject the executive roadmap handed to him by Trump shows that he is more interested in carving out a legacy for himself than slashing the government spending and red tape that led to his inflation crisis.\u00a0 If Biden put down his pen long enough to pick up a newspaper, perhaps he would see that his approach of governing by executive fiat is failing American families.\u00a0 CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM REP.

Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and the global rise in oil and gas prices illustrates the volatility of the fossil fuel market and the impact it has at the pump. The increase in fuel costs is one of the primary drivers of inflation. As consumers get squeezed with rising costs from inflation and higher fuel prices, oil companies have made record profits during this crisis. All the while, the oil industry and its allies have shamelessly called for an increase in domestic oil production, which is a false solution.\u00a0 Oil and gas production in the U.S. has been at an all-time high in recent years and the Biden-Harris administration approved more drilling permits per month than President Donald Trump did in any of his first three years in office. No matter how much fossil fuel energy we produce domestically, U.S. consumers will always be subject to price hikes based on what\u2019s happening in the global market.\u00a0 The only way to be truly energy independent is to build an American economy no longer dependent on fossil fuels.\u00a0 A renewable and clean energy economy would help combat inflation and bring more affordable, stable energy to consumers, insulating folks from the volatility we see today in the price of gas, utilities, and everyday goods. Reducing our reliance on fossil fuels will remove a huge point of economic and  political leverage  that oil-rich autocratic leaders in Russia, Iran, and Saudi Arabia wield to their benefit. That means our transition to a clean-energy economy isn\u2019t just smart domestic policy, it is also a matter of national security.\u00a0   Video Senator Joe Manchin, D-WV, reportedly wants to wait until September, when July\u2019s inflation numbers are released, to decide how to proceed on climate provisions in a reconciliation legislative package.

Unsurprisingly, no significant consensus was reached. Instead, the Biden administration continues to obstruct new domestic energy development, including considerations of a misguided oil export ban,\u202fwhile ceding markets and economic growth to Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, and Iran for oil and gas.\u00a0 \u00a0     \n      FILE \u2013 Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm speaks during a press briefing at the White House, Nov. 23, 2021, in Washington.\n       (AP Photo/Evan Vucci, File) The fact is fuel prices will not subside as long as the administration maintains a \"keep it in the ground\" stance on energy production, transportation, and sales. Instead of embracing American-sourced fossil fuel production, pipeline infrastructure, and exports, Biden has focused his efforts around blaming energy companies and constraining their operations. It wasn\u2019t that long ago that the energy industry and its workers had support from the government. When I served as secretary of Energy under  President Donald Trump , we prioritized American energy development by advancing smart tax policies and pragmatic regulation.\u00a0 VARNEY BLASTS 'TOXIC' BIDEN FOR CUTTING US ENERGY OUTPUT, SPARKING INFLATION: 'THEIR ORIGINAL MISTAKE' Thanks to our work, gone were the days of America's crippling dependence on foreign energy sources. When I left the  Department of Energy,  America was a net-exporter of American oil and natural gas.\u202f\u00a0     \n      President Biden speaks about inflation and supply chain issues at the Port of Los Angeles, Friday, June 10, 2022, in Los Angeles.\u00a0\n       (AP Photo/Damian Dovarganes) That all changed in January 2021 when  Biden killed the Keystone XL Pipeline,  restricted new oil and gas leases on federal lands, and slow walked the approval of energy infrastructure projects. And just last week, the Interior Department announced its proposed offshore leasing plan sending more mixed signals to industry. Pending the public comment period, the plan could open up to 11 lease sales or none off the U.S. coastline. These actions, coupled with Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, are not alleviating gas prices, where some states are paying over $5 a gallon and $6 in California.\u202f\u00a0 And now, the Biden administration is openly contemplating a proposed windfall profits tax to penalize the very industry that\u2019s working to strengthen America\u2019s energy security. This new tax would be a major blunder. During the Carter administration after a windfall profits tax was enacted, domestic production decreased and the U.S. increased its reliance on foreign oil.\u202f Repeating the same mistake would lead to higher prices and less production.\u00a0   Video Instead of expanding American energy production in the face of foreign turmoil, Biden has signaled more reliance on imports. Later this week,  he is heading to Saudi Arabia  in an effort to increase oil imports.\u00a0 Before traveling to Saudi Arabia, President Biden should look right here in Texas, and send a special envoy to Midland, which is one of the most critical energy producing regions in the country, to understand the need of American producers. In addition to Texas, production from the Bakken Formation in recent years has elevated North Dakota to one of the most significant sources of oil in the United States, thanks to robust business investments. Now, North Dakota accounts for nearly 10 percent of our nation\u2019s oil production, the third-largest producing state in the union.\u00a0\u00a0   Video CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER It is safe to say states like Texas, North Dakota and many others across the country have played an outsized role in helping the United States decrease its need for foreign energy sources.\u00a0 Biden can offer certainty to the  domestic energy market  by supporting critical infrastructure projects like the Keystone XL Pipeline and Dakota Access Pipeline.

Green will report raising $650,000 in the second quarter, a number the campaign is touting as evidence that Hoosiers in the district are invested in her candidacy and will turn out for her in the  November midterm election. The figure also shows that in just one quarter, Green more than doubled the amount her campaign has raised, bringing the total to nearly $1 million with $450,000 cash on hand. Speaking exclusively with Fox News Digital, Green celebrated her fundraising haul, outlined her plan to continue winning support from voters in the district and touted her military experience, as well as her experience as a Black conservative, to assert why she was the right candidate for the job.     \n      Jennifer-Ruth Green, the Republican nominee for Indiana's 1st Congressional District.\n       (Jennifer-Ruth Green campaign) INDIANA VETERAN COULD BECOME ONLY BLACK GOP CONGRESSWOMAN: \u2018I\u2019M EXHIBIT A AGAINST CRT' \"We're incredibly excited,\" Green said when asked about her fundraising haul. \"There's a huge groundswell of support\u2026 and it's just encouraging.\"\u00a0 \"We know this is going to be a multimillion dollar race, and we're going to continue to press forward so that we do everything we can just to make sure that everything is out of our hands as far as giving the voters all the information about who I am, what I am doing, about who I aspire to be as a congresswoman,\" she added. Green explained that as she goes out and talks with people in the district, her message to those facing difficulty under the  economic crises  plaguing America boiled down to three simple words: \"Gas, groceries and grandkids.\" \"People are concerned about the fact that when we are having to determine between gas and groceries as far as our spending habits go whenever we leave our house,\" she said. \"And we're spending our grandkids' money.\" \"So as fiscal irresponsibility continues to be highlighted, whether it's the president sending millions of barrels of oil to China, or whether it's the inflation that we continue to see on the shelves, whether it's our gas prices being the highest they've been for years, all those things, gas, groceries and grandkids, are the consistent things that we hear about,\" Green added, vowing that \"fiscal responsibility\" would be her priority if elected.

And we can also help the Republican Party understand more about the voting bloc that has been long absent in our party,\" she said. When asked about the  treatment of Black conservatives  by those on the left, including the liberal media and some politicians, Green explained that she had experienced the brunt of such criticism for not fitting into the mold of a traditional Black Democrat. \"I've experienced strong opposition as a Black conservative. The reality of it, though, is that people don't care how much you know until they know how much you care.

Those are the main things that you remember about Sandy Cortez. \u00a0 Now, fast forward 10 years. Suddenly, Sandy Cortez is a world-famous figure, somehow. She's calling herself  Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez , some kind of female Che, Westchester County's first socialist revolutionary and she's still yammering on about racism and eyeshadow, her twin obsessions and she's still frantically updating her social media pages. Some things have not changed, but other things have changed. \u00a0 BIDEN POINTS TO IMPORTANCE OF SAUDI 'ENERGY RESOURCES' DESPITE SAYING HE WOULDN'T ASK FOR MORE OIL \u00a0 One night you're watching TV and you see Sandy Cortez talking authoritatively about America's energy grid, like she knows a lot about it and that stops you in your tracks. Wait a second. The energy grid, that's an adult thing, right? That's not queer theory. That's real. That's a very complicated piece of infrastructure. Even a lot of engineers don't really understand how the energy grid works. How could Sandy Cortez possibly know anything about that? She can't drive a standard transmission. She can't program a coffeemaker. She doesn't even make her own bed in the morning. The energy grid? Please, it\u00a0seems preposterous. So, you grab a beer and you settle in to watch her talk about it and your jaw hangs open as you do. Here's what you see. \u00a0 BIDEN POINTS TO IMPORTANCE OF SAUDI 'ENERGY RESOURCES' DESPITE SAYING HE WOULDN'T ASK FOR MORE OIL \u00a0     \n      U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) departs after a meeting between U.S. President Joe Biden and Democratic lawmakers at the U.S. Capitol that Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi hosted to promote Biden's bipartisan infrastructure bill on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., October 1, 2021.\n       (REUTERS/Leah Millis) AOC:  We know that there is no such thing as cheap energy because the price of cheap energy has always been our lives. \u00a0 AOC:  The trampling of indigenous rights is a cause of climate change. The trampling of racial justice is a cause of climate change . \u00a0 AOC:  We're like, \"The world is going to end in 12 years if we don't address climate change and your biggest issue is, your biggest issue is how are we going to pay for it? And like, this is the war. This is our World War II.\"\u00a0 AOC:  The fossil fuel industry and the future of humanity are fundamentally incompatible. They just are. I mean, that's not a political opinion. That is the science. We continue to burn fossil fuels. Our planet will become inhabitable.\u00a0 Really? Energy, huh? How is energy generated? Do you know? What's a watt? What's amperage? Speak slowly. We've got time, but she doesn't. Instead, she yells \"the fossil fuel industry and the future of humanity are fundamentally incompatible. They just are. I mean, that's not a political opinion. That's the science.\"\u00a0 JILL BIDEN APOLOGIZES FOR 'TACOS' COMMENTS ABOUT LATINOS \u00a0 Of course it is. That's the science. Whatever I say is the science. There's no debate here. Obey. That's not how Democracy works. Thank God. You actually have to convince people and so she tried. She introduced the Green New Deal three years ago and it didn't go far. In fact, it went nowhere. In fact, virtually nobody in Congress supported it. In fact, when it came time for a vote on the Green New Deal, even her co-sponsor, the other guy who wrote it, the super woke senator from Massachusetts, voted present, not in favor. \u00a0 Now, why is that? Why did nobody actually support it? Well, because if you think cow flatulence is even in the top 200 top issues for most Americans, you're Sandy Cortez. Go back to queer theory class. Get rid of fossil fuels? Yeah. What then? Well, starvation, poverty, societal collapse. Voters, it turns out, are not into any of those things and so nothing that resembles the Green New Deal is going to pass the United States Congress in our lifetimes, provided this remains an actual democracy, which is to say, provided the public has anything to say about how they're governed. \u00a0 That's a nonstarter here. It's never going to happen by democratic means, but that doesn't mean it can't happen. It doesn't mean that ideologues can't impose the Green New Deal on weaker countries that are too poor to refuse it and over the past several years, that's exactly what they've done. \u00a0 'THE VIEW' KNOCKS HERSCHEL WALKER OVER CLIMATE CHANGE RESPONSE: 'TOO MANY HITS WHILE PLAYING FOOTBALL' \u00a0   Video So, the Green New Deal is actually taking effect around the world. So, we don't have to guess what would happen if it took effect here. We can know. That's science. Let's start with Ghana. Ghana's a pretty little country, peaceful place, actually, on the west coast of Africa. Three years ago, Ghana was in great shape. It had one of the fastest-growing economies in the world. In fact, it had\u00a0so much energy over most of the last decade, it was exporting it to its neighbors in West Africa. \u00a0 Now, those energy exports from Ghana peaked in 2014. Why that year? Well because the next year, the World Bank published this headline on its website, \"World Bank approves largest-ever guarantees for Ghana's Energy Transformation.\" Oh, when they promise to transform your energy, slow down. But Ghana didn't slow down. They just kept going. The World Bank promised to provide, and we're quoting, \"technical assistance for energy sector reforms and the drafting of a new renewable energy law.\" So, in return for all this help, Ghana agreed to limit its carbon emissions, and then they entered the Paris climate agreement. Oh, how virtuous.\u00a0 What happened next? This is the part you don't read that much about. Last year, Ghana experienced a complete shutdown of its national power supply. No more electricity, no emissions, because we have no electricity, and blackouts have continued since then. Just yesterday, a news source in Ghana reported that, \"Residents in parts of the Ashanti region who have been hit with power cuts are without water as well,\" because it turns out you need electricity to provide water also to grow food. Now, this is not a small thing. The Ashanti region has millions of people living in it. They're all now living in the Stone Age and it's not just the energy grid that's now compromised in Ghana.\u00a0 BIDEN TOO OLD TO RUN AGAIN IN 2024 SAYS NEW YORK TIMES COLUMNIST: 'SEEING SOMEONE WOBBLE ON A TIGHTROPE' \u00a0 International observers say the country is now facing severe food shortages and hunger, starvation within a matter of months. Why is that? It's a fertile country, hardworking people. Now they're running out of fertilizer. Why? Well, because for years, Sandy Cortez's friends in the NGO community pushed Ghana toward less efficient, more expensive organic fertilizers and the government of Ghana, because it's not a rich government, caved. Last year, according to Ghana's news service, Ghana's agricultural minister, \"urged local farmers to adopt an organic agriculture system to reduce the impact of climate change.\"\u00a0 Oh, what happened then? Well, the good people of Ghana, while they feel good about their  fight against climate change , are now starving and in June, last month, police in Ghana used water and tear gas to attack hundreds of demonstrators in Accra, which is the capital of Ghana. \u00a0 It's not just Ghana. The same thing just happened in Sri Lanka. In 2016, the World Economic Forum published an article by a Columbia professor called Joseph Stiglitz, one of the dumbest people on planet Earth, urging Ghana to transition to \"high productivity, organic farming.\" Now, what does Stiglitz know about farming? Ever farmed? No, but he felt strongly that Sri Lanka should try a new kind of farming and of course sold it to Sri Lankans as a pathway to prosperity. \u00a0 AOC ACCUSES PEOPLE OF CREATING DRAMA OVER THE WORD 'LATINX' DESPITE OVERWHELMING OPPOSITION TO THE TERM \u00a0   Video In 2015, the World Economic Forum published an article on its website entitled and we are quoting, \"This is how we will make Sri Lanka rich by 2025.\" You can search for that article, but it's gone now along with the government of Sri Lanka. So, they had an actual insurrection, not January 6, not a guy in horns, in a bearskin, running around on mushrooms, making weird noises. No, an actual insurrection where they like, come to your house and swim in your swimming pool, root through your sock drawer and make you leave. That's what they did to the people who run Sri Lanka. They, being the public. \u00a0 The turning point came in 2021 when the president of Sri Lanka, acting on advice from the World Economic Forum, banned the use and importation of chemical fertilizers. Now, the problem was virtually every farm in Sri Lanka uses those fertilizers to produce food, which it turns out people need every day in order to survive. As a result of that move, food prices in Sri Lanka nearly doubled. Millions more Sri Lankans now live in poverty, which is not a joke and because the economy has collapsed, Sri Lanka now cannot afford fuel imports. So, Sri Lankans are now waiting days for gasoline. Watch.\u00a0 REPORTER:  36-year-old Tuwan, an auto rickshaw driver, has spent two nights at this gas station in central Colombo. It's been an endless wait to refuel his three-wheeler. Petrol pumps are all but dry across the city. \u00a0 TUWAN:  At every petrol station we go to, they tell us they have run out of gas. \u00a0 BIDEN, HARRIS 'DAMAGED GOODS' AS DEMOCRATS LOOK PAST THEIR OWN INCUMBENTS IN RECORD TIME: CONWAY \u00a0 REPORTER:  With no fuel, Tuwan has been out of work. He leaves his rickshaw in the care of friends and heads home to meet family where the situation is equally dire. There's been a crippling shortage of cooking gas across the island nation. Tuwan's wife, Fathima has been cooking on a kerosene stool for the last three months. \u00a0 FATHIMA:   I only have this one bottle of kerosene left. It will finish after I heat the food tonight. \u00a0 What's so interesting is millions of people are now really suffering. The government just fell in Sri Lanka. Now, no one in Sri Lanka is White. They are what our Democratic Party would call people of color and yet the American intellectuals who pushed that disaster in Sri Lanka, who are responsible for the suffering there, have escaped all culpability. No one is saying a word about it. Meanwhile, a cop in Minneapolis was rough with a convicted felon two years ago and we have to stop everything and send him to prison for life, but Joseph Stiglitz is totally fine and it's not just happening, by the way, in the Third World. It's happening even in rich countries.\u00a0 The Netherlands, for example, which is a very rich country, the second-biggest food exporter in the world, tried to do, for reasons that are not clear but may have to do with Western guilt, the same thing that leaders in Sri Lanka tried to do. They just ordered farmers to cut virtually all of their nitrogen oxide emissions to \"save the environment.\" Now, doing that would shutter most farms in the Netherlands and destroy the country's food supply and once again, that led to riots. So, everything that's happened in Sri Lanka and Ghana and the Netherlands is happening at the behest not simply of ideologues, but of some of the largest financial institutions in the world. \u00a0 MSNBC, CNN, NY TIMES SPOTLIGHT BIDEN\u2019S CRATERING APPROVAL, CALLS FOR NEW 2024 CANDIDATE: \u2018POLITICAL MESS\u2019 \u00a0   Video They want more of this. It's why Ghana has achieved a near-perfect ESG environmental impact score of 97.7. According to World Economic Research, Sri Lanka has an ESG score of 98.1, the Netherlands 90.7. So, the poorer you get, the more human suffering there is, the higher your ESG score and that's important because companies will not invest unless you have a high ESG score. Interesting. So, these countries have no choice and that's why South Africa, for example, works so hard to get an ESG score that now totals 91.\u00a0 Now, that effort began in 2015 when South Africa switched to renewables. Now, how did that work? Well, like everything in South Africa, no one in America really wants to know. It's their favorite country. It's a huge success. What's life like in South Africa for people of all colors? Shh, stop. Well, the Guardian, of all places reported at the time, and we are quoting \"solar, biomass and wind energy systems are popping up all over the country and feeding the clean energy into the strained electrical grid.\"\u00a0 So, their grids have been falling apart since 1994, but no problem. The green energy geniuses are going to save South Africa. How did that work?\u00a0 Well, seven years later, The Washington Post reports that South Africa regularly experiences \"rolling blackouts that last 8 hours or more, crippling economic activity and disrupting life in this nation of 60 million people,\" and that's true. Ask anyone who lives there. It's falling apart. Doesn't work. \u00a0 CNN, MSNBC IGNORE JILL BIDEN'S 'BREAKFAST TACOS' GAFFE IN BROADCASTS \u00a0 Also join France. France is committed to renewable energy. How's that working? Well, France currently has an ESG environmental score of 92.6. Why? Because 10 years ago, France pledged to drive a quarter of all of its energy from renewables in 2018. These policies led to riots. Remember the so-called yellow jackets? People didn't like it. If you cared about democracy, you would listen to them, but no one in charge actually does, so they don't and things have gotten worse since then. This past June, the heads of three French energy companies called on the public to \"immediately reduce consumption of fuel, oil, electricity and gas amid shortages and soaring prices.\"\u00a0 Oh, stop civilization. It doesn't work. That same month, France's president publicly begged Joe Biden to start producing more oil because the Saudis cannot make enough to supply Europe. Watch.\u00a0 FRENCH PRESIDENT MACRON:  Told me two things, \"I'm at the maximum, maximum.\" What he claims, this is my complete commitment. Second, he told me the Saudis can increase a little bit to one hundred fifty or a little bit more and they don't have huge capacities and this before six months' time.\u00a0 So only the Europeans have been dumb enough to embrace this. Unlike Ghana, they could afford not to, but they are anyway out of some weird sense of collective guilt. So, what's happening throughout Europe? In the UK, ESG score of 92.7, the National Infrastructure Commission has warned that as many as 6 million households could face power cuts this summer. Sound like the First World? No, it doesn't, but that's England now. In Germany, ESG score 90.2. The government is now rationing hot water due to an ongoing gas crisis. Officials in Hamburg, Germany's second largest city, just warned that \"warm water could only be made available at certain times of the day in an emergency.\" Now, just a few years ago, that Germany's government laughed at warnings from Donald Trump that this would happen. It's on video. \"Yeah, they are so stupid. You have no idea. Green energy is the future.\"\u00a0 MEXICAN PRESIDENT CALLS ON BIDEN TO 'REGULARIZE' MIGRANTS IN US: 'THE WAY OUT IS THROUGH TRANSFORMATION' \u00a0     \n      Emmanuel Macron, France's president, speaks during an address to inhabitants and elected officials in Spezat, France, on Tuesday, April 5, 2022.\n       (Photographer: Nathan Laine/Bloomberg via Getty Images) Every place that's been tried has fallen apart. Every single one with no exceptions\u2014Albania, Kenya, Argentina, Peru, Ecuador, Panama, Libya, so on, but it's not just a problem there. It's becoming a problem here. So, the United States are ESG scoring in environmental issues currently stands at 58, but Joe Biden, who buys into every stupid trend, wants to change that. It's very important to get our ESG score up because we want to be more like Ghana. So, at the very moment that Biden is sending our Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which we own, he doesn't to his son's business partners in China, he is vowing to end fossil fuels in this country and boost our ESG score. Watch. \u00a0 DANA BASH, 2019:  Would there be any place for fossil fuels, including coal and fracking in a Biden administration? \u00a0 BIDEN:  No, we would work it out. We would make sure it's eliminated and no more subsidies for either one of those. Either way, any fossil fuel.\u00a0 BIDEN, 2020 DEBATE:  No more subsidies for fossil fuel industry. No more drilling on federal lands. No more drilling, including offshore. No ability for the oil industry to continue to drill. Period. \u00a0 BIDEN, 2019:  But I want you to look in my eyes. I guarantee you, I guarantee you we're going to end fossil fuel and I am not going to cooperate, ok?\u00a0\u00a0 WASHINGTON POST PUBLISHER SLAMS BIDEN FOR UPCOMING SAUDI ARABIA TRIP: 'ERODES OUR MORAL AUTHORITY' \u00a0 So, let's just be really clear. Fossil fuels aren't just not bad. Fossil fuels aren't just a net good. Fossil fuels are the only thing that stands between the United States becoming Ghana. Fossil fuels are the only thing that make the United States a rich country and not a poor country. We have the largest recoverable oil reserves in the world. If we can't tap those, we will be Ghana. We will be poor, but Joe Biden doesn't care and so he is clamping down on our ability to extract them and like the leaders of every other country, driven into the ground by green energy schemes thought up by morons like Sandy Cortez, he's taking no responsibility for the damage he has caused. \u00a0 BIDEN: \u00a0Look, we need more refining capacity. This idea that they don't have oil to drill and to bring up is simply not true. This piece of the Republicans talking about Biden shutdown fields, wrong. 9,000 of them, ok? So, then we ought to be able to work something out whereby they're able to increase refining capacity and still not give up on transitioning to renewable energy . \u00a0 Problem is, he doesn't know anything about refining or extracting or how the grid works or anything about anything because he's never had a real job because he's work ed  for the federal government since he was in his twenties. None of these people have any experience doing anything. Again, most of them can't drive in manual transmission. So, to get a lecture on the power grid or energy from people who have no idea what it\u00a0is a bit much and the topic is too important to continue to listen to their nonsense as we become poorer. And by the way, as the rift just beneath the surface in American society are exacerbated by that poverty, as GDP drops, societal tension rises. It's dangerous.\u00a0 COVID IS SPIKING AND BIDEN WHITE HOUSE IS ASLEEP ONCE AGAIN \u00a0     \n      President Biden speaks about inflation and supply chain issues at the Port of Los Angeles, Friday, June 10, 2022, in Los Angeles.\u00a0\n       (AP Photo/Damian Dovarganes) Back off and it's accelerated. In the past year, the United States has experienced blackouts in some of our biggest states. Why? Because they're relying more and more on renewables, places like California and even Texas. Just yesterday, in order to avoid a blackout, the largest grid operator in the state of Texas, begged residents to turn up their thermostats, no\u00a0more AC for you and ask them not to use any major appliances, really, in Texas, which is the largest oil and gas reserves in the continental United States. \u00a0 CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \u00a0 What are they doing in Texas? But across the country, this is true. Orlando, Florida recently experiment with fertilizer bans to \"curb pollution.\" So, the World Economic Forum wants a lot more of this. They just released a position paper calling for countries to \"agree to end the underpricing of fossil fuels, which is the principal factor preventing a clean energy transition.\"\u00a0 In other words, it's too cheap. It works too well. Gas needs to be higher so you won't be able to use it. So, you'll have to be poor. And they're saying this as we're watching countries around the world \u2013 we can give you more detail, you see the point \u2013 are collapsing and entering into a state of revolution because these morons tampered with their energy grids. But they don't care. They're going to continue doing it unless someone stops them until exactly the same thing happens here.

That's how we think of you.\u00a0 So, the good news is America at this stage is getting a lot more amusing. The bad news is it's also getting a little scary. So today, in the second category, the government announced that inflation has once again set a year-over-year record. But now we're used to this. If you buy anything, you already knew it was happening. Boy, did you. But there were parts of today's Labor Department report that were not expected by anyone. In fact, they were bizarre. They seemed to defy the most basic rules of economics, but first, here are the raw numbers. This is from a Fox News report today.\u00a0 CAROLINE SHIVELY, FOX NEWS:  Inflation cranked up a whopping 9.1% in June, the highest yearly jump since 1981. The Consumer Price Index, released Wednesday morning, showed the price of necessities far outpacing raises. The price of gas is up almost 60% year over year. Rent went up 5.6% over last June and food at home and dining out, increasing 10.4%. If you break it down to just groceries, the annual jump was 12.2%. That includes eggs up 33% and butter up 26%. \u00a0 So, the biggest annual spike in inflation in more than 40 years. That's the headline. But if anything, it understates what's actually going on. The reality of it is worse than that. During the Carter years, when inflation famously hit 14.6%, wages were still going up. As Pew put it in a recent analysis, \"During the high inflation years of the 1970s and early 1980s, average wages commonly jumped seven, eight, even 9% year over year\" and that makes sense. There's more money in circulation. It's worth less, but there's more of it. But that is not what is happening right now and that's the weird thing. \u00a0 JILL BIDEN'S 'BREAKFAST TACOS' REMARK WAS NOT A GAFFE. IT WAS INTENTIONAL AND WILL DRIVE LATINOS TO THE GOP \u00a0   Video According to the Labor Department report today, \"Real average hourly earnings decreased 3.6%, seasonally adjusted from June 2021 to June 2022. The change in real average hourly earnings, combined with a decrease of 0.9% of the average workweek, resulted in a 4.4% decrease in real average weekly earnings over this period.\" 4.4% average decrease in earnings. This is what economic disaster looks like. \u00a0 Americans are making less money at exactly the moment when everything they buy from gas to groceries is more expensive and not just a little more expensive, a lot more expensive. Here's the big picture. The average American household income this year is about $87,000.\u00a0 Today's inflation numbers means the average household is losing nearly $8,000 a year just from inflation. By the way, that's using the government's cooked numbers, the 9.1% inflation number, which is derived from the intentionally deceptive consumer price index (CPI), so the real number is actually higher than that. Rising inflation with falling wages. This is very bad, and as we said, it's also very weird. How weird? Well, here's one measure of the strangeness. The  price of gas  is now much cheaper in Mexico than it is in the United States, and that's why so many Californians are now driving across the border to fill their cars.\u00a0 GOP LATINA HOUSE CANDIDATE RIPS JILL BIDEN'S 'TACOS' REMARK: 'IT'S A TRAVESTY' \u00a0 Now, why is this happening? That does not make sense. Oil prices set on the international market. But apart from a few outlier websites like ZeroHedge, which not coincidentally the left is always trying to shut down and censor, no one seems to be asking that question. We do know that gas prices in Mexico are so cheap that the Mexican government is encouraging more Americans to cross the border to refuel their cars. \u00a0 \"Right now,\" said the president of Mexico this week, \"a gallon of regular cost $4.78 average on your side of the border, while in Mexico, it cost $3.12.\" So, you have to ask yourself if we're paying more for gas because of Putin's price hike, why isn't Mexico paying more for gas because of Putin, too? Why is inflation up when wages are down? This doesn't make any sense. So, if you want to answer those questions, you really have to look at government spending. \u00a0 Last month, Mexico's government did not follow the Biden administration's lead in sending the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to China. They did not do that. Instead, here's what Mexico did. They spent $2 billion in subsidies to keep gas prices lower for consumers. In other words, the government of Mexico in the middle of a drug war is taking better care of its citizens than Joe Biden is taking care of his citizens and that is shameful, but it doesn't mean Joe Biden is ignoring the needy. \u00a0 In the very same month, the gas prices shot beyond the reach of people, people aren't taking trips because of gas prices, Joe Biden, in the name of democracy, signed a $40 billion aid package, not for you or any other American, but for Ukraine and that money, Joe Biden says, is just the beginning. It's part of our unlimited commitment to funding Ukraine's corrupt and authoritarian government. Here's Biden.\u00a0 CNN, MSNBC, CNBC REACT TO JUNE INFLATION NUMBERS: 'NOT GOOD NEWS FOR ANYBODY' \u00a0     \n      U.S. President Joe Biden speaks during an event to celebrate passage of the \"Safer Communities Act,\" on the South Lawn at the White House in Washington, U.S., July 11, 2022.\n       (REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque/File Photo) REPORTER:  \"For as long as it takes.\" Does it mean indefinite support from the United States or Ukraine, or will there come a time when you have to say to President Zelenskyy that the United States cannot support his country any longer? Thank you. \u00a0 PRESIDENT BIDEN:  We are going to support Ukraine as long as it takes. We are going to stick with Ukraine and all of the allies will stick with Ukraine as long as it takes. \u00a0 REPORTER:  The war has pushed prices up. It could go as high as $200 a barrel, some analysts think. How long is it fair to expect American drivers and drivers around the world to pay that premium for this war?\u00a0 BIDEN: \u00a0As long as it takes. Russia cannot, in fact, defeat Ukraine and move beyond Ukraine.\u00a0 Future generations will look at that tape and many tapes like it with their jaws open. As long as it takes! Whatever the cost for Ukraine! As the American economy heads toward total destruction, Ukrainians are dying in large numbers, who's winning? Well, Ukrainian oligarchs, they're getting richer, much richer. Since January of this year, the Biden administration has sent about $8 billion just in so-called security assistance alone to Ukraine. That would include missile systems, howitzers, ammunition, radar systems, etc., etc.\u00a0 AVERAGE AMERICAN WORKER HAS LOST $3,400 IN ANNUAL WAGES UNDER BIDEN THANKS TO INFLATION \u00a0 Now, defense contractors are making a ton from this, and that's why they have lobbied for it so hard, but you have to ask, once we send these weapons to Ukraine, where do they go then? What happens to them? These are sophisticated and deadly weapons systems. Well, no one knows where they go. No one's keeping track. U.S. officials, Biden administration officials have admitted that to The Wall Street Journal and we're quoting: \"Once U.S. equipment material is handed to the Ukrainian government U.S. officials said they have little direct knowledge of where that material goes. They rely instead on the Ukrainian government for such information. The administration has not agreed to allow American military troops to conduct some oversight into that country.\" Huh? So, you send billions to Ukraine in the middle of a war, and then you don't bother to find out what happens to it? What will happen to these weapons? Well, the Czech defense minister knows he has said these weapons, some of them will be smuggled out of Ukraine, \"It's hard to avoid trafficking or smuggling. We didn't achieve it in the former Yugoslavia and we probably won't avoid it in Ukraine.\"\u00a0 This is lunacy. If you wanted to make Eastern Europe dangerous and unstable for generations, ensure that war continues and many more die, this is exactly what you would do. You would treat Ukraine like we treated Afghanistan, but that's just the beginning of the money we're sending. On top of all of this security assistance, now, the head of USAID, that would be Samantha Power \u2013 she's never left, she's still here, amazingly, after wrecking the world \u2013 she's announced we're sending $4 billion more to Ukraine to pay off that country's budget deficit. Wouldn't that be nice if Samantha Power decided to pay off our budget deficit, if anyone decided to help us? But no, no one would ever do that. \u00a0 BIDEN'S APPROVAL RATING WOULD BE HIGHER IF INFLATION WASN'T 'CONSTANTLY IN THE NEWS,' SUGGESTS WAPO COLUMN \u00a0     \n      Russian President Vladimir Putin has signed into law legislation that could punish journalists with up to 15 years in prison for reporting so-called \"fake\" news about his military invasion of Ukraine. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\n       (Yuri Kochetkov/Pool) So, your tax dollars are now paying the salaries of Ukrainian government bureaucrats. In all, your Congress has approved more than $50 billion for Ukraine. That includes $7 billion in food assistance and health care, along with $9 billion for economic support, whatever that means. There's also $2 billion for refugee assistance. So, just as we did in Iraq and Afghanistan and I don't know, half a dozen other countries, we're sending bales of $100 bills into a war zone and hoping they find the right pockets. Again, this is nuts. And yet leaders of both parties agree we have to keep doing it, much more of it. \u00a0 Dozens of Democrats in Congress just signed a letter pushing the administration, as if they needed to be pushed, toward the International Monetary Fund, a total of $650 billion in new funding because Ukraine and on top of all of that, Congressman Adam Kinzinger just proposed an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act calling for another hundred million for, \"Ukrainian military pilots and associated personnel.\" Kinzinger is the guy who thought the ghost of Kiev was real. Now all of this is necessary. It's mandatory. We must, according to members of both parties, because we must defend democracy. Now we're not picking on Senator Kevin Cramer of North Dakota, a Republican state, but we want to show you this tape. He just sat for an interview with Charlie Kirk and explained that we have to send an unlimited amount of money to Ukraine. Why? To \"fight back against communist intrusion for the cause of freedom because Vladimir Putin is evil.\" Watch. \u00a0 BIDEN ECONOMIC ADVISER BERNSTEIN ADMITS INFLATION 'UNACCEPTABLY ELEVATED,' CALLS FOR 'MORE POLICY' \u00a0 CHARLIE KIRK: \u00a0What amount of money is too much to send to Ukraine because we just did $1.7 billion more? Where is the line because we're up near $56 billion now?\u00a0\u00a0 SEN.CRAMER:  Sure. Well, I don't know that the line is a dollar amount, Charlie. I think each request or each requirement, each demand, each circumstance requires its own discovery, if you will. I don't think we should do a whole bunch necessarily at one time. I think that we should do smaller tranches just for the purpose of renegotiating, you know, reassessing. The price of letting Ukraine fall to Russia, to the United States taxpayer and to the cause of liberty, I think is very, very high. \u00a0 Yeah. Fighting the communist menace. These people never update their talking points. Senator Cramer invokes the cause of liberty and that's a phrase we strongly support. That's an idea we strongly support. That's why we're in favor of unfettered free speech. That's why we oppose vaccine mandates. But you have to ask yourself, what does the cause of liberty have to do with Ukraine? Well, very little. Last February, the Ukrainian government shut down opposition media. Then they arrested the leader of the main opposition party.\u00a0 UKRAINE RAISES FLAG OVER SNAKE ISLAND IN WAR GAIN \u00a0   Video Now, President Zelenskyy has decided to combine all television stations in Ukraine into a state-owned propaganda ministry in order to combat \"misinformation.\" Now, what is that? Well, I'll tell you what, it's not. It's not the profile of a free country. Not even close. The cause of liberty. May those words burn in your mouth. \"Oh, but we have to,\" they tell us,\" because Putin is worse. He's the worst person in the world.\" He's a communist, says Senator Camer, who plans to conquer the globe. You don't have to like Vladimir Putin to see how absurd this is. Putin's a communist now. Really? How communist is Vladimir Putin? Is Vladimir Putin more or less communist than, say, Sandy Cortez? More or less communist than\u00a0say Joe Biden's domestic policy team? Is he more committed atheist than they are? Is Putin throwing Americans in jail for attending political rallies at the Capitol? Is he trying to confiscate the rifles from your bedroom? Is he sterilizing children in the name of trans liberation? Whatever his many faults, no, Vladimir Putin is not doing any of that.\u00a0 As for his apparently limitless international ambitions, ask yourself, is Vladimir Putin recolonizing Africa right now? Is Vladimir Putin trying to build military bases in the Caribbean and South America? No, he's not, but another country is. That would be China, Joe Biden's patron. Putin wants Crimea. He may succeed in getting it, but it is China that is on its way to controlling the world. Here's a graphic we saw today that illustrates the point. \u00a0 BIDEN MAKES HOLOCAUST GAFFE DURING ISRAEL VISIT \u00a0 These are the relative sizes of the players in the global economy. The numbers are from the IMF. As you can see, the world is completely dominated by the economic power of China and the United States. As of today, our\u00a0two economies roughly equal in size, though thanks to COVID, China is quickly pulling ahead. That is a problem. In fact, that is the biggest problem in the world by far. Nothing comes close because the Chinese empire will not be like our empire at all.\u00a0 So, where's Russia in this? How does it fit in? Well, get your reading glasses, because Russia is a footnote. It's not irrelevant, but it's close to irrelevant.Russia's economy is smaller than Italy's. The Italians, in other words, are in a better position to take over the \u00a0world than Vladimir Putin is. This entire conversation is insane. Anyone who takes it seriously is a fool, and anyone who doesn't see the red flags is probably dishonest. The most dishonest, the most power-hungry people in the United States are the very ones yelling the loudest for a war with Russia. That would be Joe Biden. That would be Nancy Pelosi. That'd be Chuck Schumer. That'd be Adam Schiff. \u00a0 These are the people telling you that Vladimir Putin is a war criminal bent on world domination. Why are they saying that? Why are you suggesting Vladimir Putin's going to take over Europe? That's not true, but why are they saying it? \u00a0 ECONOMIST LAFFER SAYS RECESSION IMMINENT AS INFLATION HITS 40-YEAR-HIGH: 'WORST OF ALL POSSIBLE WORLDS' \u00a0   Video Well, there's a reason, a reason that has precisely nothing to do with saving lives or making Ukraine a better country. Again, red flag, anyone? And yet somehow Republicans don't see it. They don't seem curious about why the worst people in America are for an endless  war with Russia.  In fact, apart from Marjorie Taylor Greene and a few other Republicans in Congress, they are all in. Whatever Joe Biden wants in Ukraine they support. Here, for example, is Lindsey Graham with his little friend Richard Blumenthal, that would be Connecticut's most famous Vietnam War hero. Here they are together. \u00a0 SEN. RICHARD BLUMENTHAL: \u00a0This picture ought to tell you something about America right now. There's bipartisan support to defeat Putin, to call him out as a pariah and a war criminal. \u00a0 SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM:  When we get back, we're going to try to get the Senate, as a whole, to pass the resolution, hopefully leading the way for the administration to label Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism in the category of Iran, Syria and North Korea.  \u00a0 JESSE WATTERS: MOVING BACK IN WITH YOUR PARENTS ISN'T THE AMERICAN DREAM \u00a0 Defeat Putin. Will that improve your life? Is it improving the lives of the Ukrainians right now? No, it's not and yet every person who has been on the wrong side of every foreign policy decision going back 40 years is on the same page and that, of course, would include John Bolton, the former national security adviser, who by the way just admitted on national television that he has personally engineered coups in foreign countries. Wait, we're not for democracy? Apparently not. John Bolton isn't. But wasn't democracy the whole point? Were those coups state - sponsored terror? No one's asking. No one's calling John Bolton a war criminal. Instead, here's what they're saying. \u00a0 JIM CRAMER, CNBC:  Biden studiously avoids doing the one thing, though, that could really bring down the price of crude. He needs to arm the Ukrainians to the teeth so they can quickly beat Russia and put the war to bed. Can we make Ukraine safe for agriculture? Sure, but we might have to set up a no-fly zone in the western part of the country, which Biden doesn't want to do. He doesn't want to create a no-fly zone because that's American fighter planes firing at Russian ones and it's a hop, skip and a jump from there, nuclear war. I understand that. By the way, I think there's a very good argument for that, but a no-fly zone is, while extremely risky, it is the best way to get food inflation under control. \u00a0 Wait, what? I tuned in to find out whether I should buy Cisco on the dip and you're a foreign policy expert now. The American economy is in serious trouble. It's heading south faster than anyone anticipated, but instead, you flip on CNBC and the geniuses are talking about World War III, and they're not the only ones. So, if you want to know how big this has become, how ominous this is, in the absence of attention from the rest of us, we've kind of slept walked up to this point, you should see this. This is from the city of New York, our largest city. This is a public service announcement reminding the 8 million residents of New York they could soon be nuked.\u00a0 WOMAN:  So, there's been a nuclear attack. Don't ask me how or why. Just know that the big one has hit. Okay, so what do we do? Step one: get inside fast. You, your friends, your family, get inside. Stay inside. Shut all doors and windows. Have a basement? Head there. If you were outside after the blast, get clean immediately. Remove and bag all outer clothing to keep radioactive dust or ash away from your body. \u00a0 CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \u00a0   Video What?

Then you get to the part where she says \"radioactive dust\" and you snap to it. Radioactive dust? You're suggesting that someone might lob a nuclear weapon into our largest city? What? Why the chirpy tone? What the hell are you talking about?\u00a0 How do we get so close to nuclear war that the city of New York is telling me to wash the radioactive dust off my pants? This is total lunacy. This is crazy. Why are we doing this? Because Putin's bad and he's going to take over Belgium?\u00a0 Because nobody has said anything and because the Republican Party has collaborated with the nutcases in the Biden administration, we have reached the point where some chirpy lady on TV is telling you to prepare for the deaths of tens of millions of Americans.

That's what we should be doing.  Energy independence  is not just a slogan, because the opposite of it is energy dependence.

Morgan\u2019s attack on Salenville, Ohio, in late July 1863 \u2014 just weeks after the rebel defeat at Gettysburg, Pa. \u2014 marked the northernmost advance of Confederate forces  during the Civil War .\u00a0 Morgan landed a job in the garment industry, inventing \u2014 among other things \u2014 a zigzag stitch pattern for sewing machines.   He was killed in battle in Greenville, Tenn., on Sept. 4, 1864. Sydney Morgan \u2014 the general\u2019s son and father of the inventor \u2014 was freed after the cavalry officer\u2019s death. Sydney married another former slave, Eliza Reed, sometime after the war. They were both of mixed-race descent (including Native American for Reed), according to the most current family knowledge, said Sandra Morgan.\u00a0 \"They were not farmhands. They lived in the city,\" meaning Lexington, Ky., she said. \"They were urbanites. They had exposure to many different things. Sydney couldn\u2019t read or write, I don\u2019t believe.

Morgan Hair Refining Co.\u00a0 MEET THE AMERICAN WHO INVENTED THE MOTOR HOME It stayed in business until 1976, the family said.\u00a0 He also became active in civic affairs, especially those championing African-American success. He helped found the Cleveland Association of Colored Men in 1908 and the all-Black Wakeman Country Club, on land he purchased in 1923, according to the Encyclopedia of Cleveland History. Morgan became active in civic affairs, especially those that championed African-American success.\u00a0   He married Mary, a first-generation American whose parents immigrated from Bohemia, now part of the Czech Republic.\u00a0 The mixed-race family felt the sting of public prejudice: Mary was ex-communicated from the Catholic Church by the local bishop for marrying a Black man, Sandra Morgan said. But the couple forged a formidable partnership.     \n      Garrett Morgan filed a patent application for a new breathing device in 1912, which was approved in 1914. His system proved its worth as a gas mask in a 1916 Lake Erie tunnel fire and on the battlefield in World War I.\u00a0\n       (Public Domain) The couple owned a hugely successful ladies' clothing store, which employed up to 32 people, according to family history.\u00a0 After reading about the horror of the 1911 Triangle Shirtwaist fire, Garrett Morgan set about creating a mask to help rescue workers breath safely amid toxic conditions. Many of the 146 who were killed in the New York City fire died of smoke inhalation.\u00a0 He filed a patent for his \"breathing device\" in 1912, and received approval in 1914\u00a0 AMERICAN SOLDIERS KILLED IN WWI REMEMBERED FOREVER IN NYC ALEHOUSE He struggled to sell the mask, however.

One official recalled that Cleveland inventor Morgan had been shopping a breathing device around to fire departments. \"He rustled his brother Frank,\" Sandra Morgan told Smithsonian. \"They threw a bunch of gas masks in the car \u2014 remember, they were selling these things \u2014 and in their pajamas, drove down to the lakefront.\" The Morgan brothers plus two volunteers donned the masks and descended into the hole.     \n      \"They Died Crawling: And Other Tales of Cleveland Woe,\" by John Stark Bellamy II, includes the harrowing details of Garrett Morgan's daring rescue of men during the Lake Erie crib disaster of 1916.\n       (Gray & Co.

Elaine Luria, D-Va., for the seat. Both candidates talked exclusively to Fox News Digital, answering the same set of questions that are important to  Virginia voters . What do you think of President Biden\u2019s current handling of the economy, and if you are elected in November, what policies would you promote to respond to inflation and the costs of consumer goods around the country? Luria : \"Though unemployment remains at record lows,  inflation and rising energy costs  continue to risk our economic recovery and impact Coastal Virginians and working families across the country. I remain committed to working with both sides of the aisle on legislation like the COMPETES Act, the Lower Food and Fuel Costs Act, and the Price Gouging Prevention Act.

From  record inflation , to the highest gas prices we\u2019ve seen in decades, to labor shortages and a seemingly never ending supply chain crisis, the American people need help. In Congress, I look forward to restoring the strength of the American economy. To start we need to restore energy independence by reopening the keystone pipeline and to open up federal leases for drilling on federal lands. We also need to curb the Democrats and Biden administration\u2019s reckless spending policies that are overheating the economy, causing the record inflation and labor shortages we are currently facing. We also need to roll back government regulations that the Biden administration has placed on businesses that are increasing inflation and attempting to regulate companies out of existence.\"     \n      U.S. Rep.

In addition, Virginia\u2019s Second Congressional District is home to a huge population of active duty military members and veterans. These Virginians, like so many others, are concerned with America\u2019s standing on the world stage, especially after Joe Biden\u2019s reckless withdrawal from Afghanistan.

This is caused by reckless spending,\" he said. \"Every proposal Democrats have is spend your money, spend more money. We\u2019ve got to reduce taxes, reduce fees, reduce the size of government.

Eighty-four percent said it is in only fair or poor shape. And a 52% majority thinks it will be worse next year.

Fifty-five percent say the administration has made the economy worse, and more voters blame Biden (31%) for gas prices than think Russia (20%) or oil companies (14%) are responsible.\u00a0 Martin predicted that \"you are going to see the\u00a0polls continue to fall as some\u00a0of the economic data, the inflation\u00a0numbers continue to\u00a0get worse.\"   Video Martin made the comment four days after it was revealed that  inflation accelerated more than expected  to a new four-decade high in June as the price of everyday necessities remains painfully high, exacerbating a financial strain for millions of Americans.\u00a0 The Labor Department said Wednesday the consumer price index, a broad measure of the price for everyday goods, including gasoline, groceries and rents, rose 9.1% in June from a year ago. Prices jumped 1.3% in the one-month period from May. Those figures were both far higher than the 8.8% headline figure and 1% monthly gain forecast by Refinitiv economists.\u00a0 The data marked the\u00a0 fastest pace of inflation \u00a0since December 1981.\u00a0 Price increases were extensive, suggesting that inflation may not be near its peak:\u00a0 Energy prices \u00a0rose 7.5% in June from the previous month, and are up 41.6% from last year. Gasoline, on average, costs 59.9% more than it did one year ago and 11.2% more than it did in May.

NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!\n   Crime waves swept major cities  across the country two years ago amid the summer of 2020\u2019s protests and riots and the coronavirus lockdowns that upended society. Crime has continued raging in many cities while residents cope with a heavy cost that has been compounded by record-high inflation.\u00a0 \"As a purely factual matter, prices do tend to be higher -- and the quality of service and products lower -- in stores in low-income neighborhoods,\" economist Thomas Sowell wrote in an opinion piece in 2006.\u00a0 He said that many \"ghetto stores\" charge higher prices for a bevy of reasons, including \"crime, shoplifting, vandalism and riots have raised the costs, both directly and by causing insurance rates and the costs of security to be higher.\" Sowell's words have proven true in recent years. Commercial insurance rose in 2021 following the George Floyd protests and riots of the summer prior, which marked \"the first civil disorder catastrophe event to exceed $1 billion in losses to the insurance industry,\" according to the World Economic Forum. Battered stores in cities have taken extra security measures and even cut operating hours to help curb rampant shoplifting.\u00a0 SIX MAJOR CITIES ON PACE TO PASS HISTORIC 2021 VIOLENT CRIME TOTALS HALFWAY THROUGH 2022     \n      Surveillance video from Princess Bride Diamonds shows workers fight off smash and grab robbers at Bella Terra mall in Huntington Beach, California.\u00a0\n       (Princess Bride Diamonds) Crime has ravaged major cities over the last two years, with murders nationally spiking by 30% in 2020 when compared to 2019. Those spikes were even more steep in cities like New York City, which recorded a 44% increase in homicides compared to the year prior, Seattle, which saw their homicide rate increased by 61% in 2020 and by 40% in Philadelphia when compared to 2019.\u00a0 Property crimes and thefts have also seen increases, including at businesses within cities. Most notably in California, cities such as Los Angeles and the Bay Area were ravaged by smash and grab crimes last year that have carried over into 2022.\u00a0 Rampant shoplifting caused stores such as Walgreens and other chains to close in cities throughout the Golden State. Convenience stores in Philadelphia have been \"closing left and right\" this year while a couple of pharmacies in New York City closed up shop after reports they were repeated targets of shoplifting.\u00a0 PHILADELPHIA BUSINESSES 'CLOSING LEFT AND RIGHT' OVER INCREASE IN SHOPLIFTING: 'VERY DANGEROUS' For many people living in those cities, a store closure means a disruption of how people get things as simple as bread or milk, and can add additional transportation costs.\u00a0 \"If you're middle class or upper class, if Walgreens closes, it's not that big of a deal, maybe a minor inconvenience.

You may not be able to walk the extra few miles, you may not be able to get public transportation to go the extra few miles. If you're working, reduced hours can impact your availability to get basic needs met,\" he added.\u00a0 Historically, people  living in cities  have carried heavier costs at local grocery stores and bodegas.

Studies have found  inflation often hurts  low-income families, minority communities and Americans in rural parts of the nation the most. Low-income households are often \"exposed\" to items hit the hardest by inflation, such as energy and food, while lower levels of savings and incomes are unable to easily absorb the higher costs compared to wealthier households, a Bank of America study published in November found.\u00a0 For many, inflation is a financial double whammy.

Democrats may be wrong about nearly everything, but they are not given to political suicide.\u00a0 The chattering class has engaged in an absurd back-and-forth about the prospects of a Biden 2024 run, even as the feeble president scores epically bad approval ratings and has lost the backing of his own party.\u00a0\u00a0 Just recently, the Washington Post published a list of Democrat 2024 political hopefuls and included Biden on the list.\u00a0 BIDEN COVID CZAR VOICES SUPPORT FOR LA BRINGING BACK INDOOR MASK MANDATE In previous rankings, they  had not included the president;  they explained the earlier omission by writing \"In the seemingly unlikely scenario he didn\u2019t run again, the idea was, here\u2019s who would be next in line.\" Now, the Post says that \"scenario seemed to be growing more likely,\" so Biden is on the list.

So, they put him top of the list. No wonder most normal Americans ignore political punditry. \u00a0 Why would anyone take a Biden candidacy seriously? Because Biden himself is, suggests the Post. Apparently, his team is preparing for a run, emboldened, like the president himself, by that same poll that showed, in spite of everything, Biden would still top Trump 44-41.\u00a0 The logic is that Donald Trump will be the 2024 GOP candidate and that Uncle Joe is the only Democrat who can beat him. Everything about this assertion is nonsensical.\u00a0 Joe Biden beat Donald Trump in 2020 because voters were tired of The Donald\u2019s abrasive and unpredictable personality and were convinced that Biden would provide \"normalcy.\" They believed Biden when he promised to bring the country together and many expected him to govern as a political moderate. Polling showed that millions voted against Donald Trump, not for Joe Biden.\u00a0\u00a0   Video Not only were Americans exhausted by the Trump melodrama, they also \u2014 importantly \u2014 were comfortable. By that I mean they had been lured into complacency by many years in which the economy had grown steadily, inflation was nonexistent and our country was at peace.\u00a0 They had no idea how much damage Joe Biden could do.\u00a0 Yes, we were enduring the scourge of Covid-19, and many blamed President Trump for the destruction wreaked by that devastating Chinese import.

Consumer sentiment was climbing quickly and businesses were optimistic as well. Employers created 672,000 jobs in September 2020, and 638,000 more in the month that followed.\u00a0 Stock prices bottomed in late March 2020 and the S&P Index jumped almost 30% by the end of October. \u00a0 Thanks to soaring stock markets and generous government handouts, consumers had piled up tens of trillions of dollars in additional net worth and trillions in excess savings.\u00a0Americans were optimistic about their financial futures.\u00a0 The result? The election did not turn on the merits of economic policy, or the jobs outlook, which usually determine voter choices. It turned on chasing out of office a president who had outworn his welcome. \u00a0Though history has a way of repeating itself, it is highly unlikely that Biden would again beat Trump.\u00a0   Video First, the public\u2019s opinion of Biden\u2019s character has deteriorated dramatically. YouGov tracking shows nearly half the country now thinks the president is not honest and trustworthy, compared to 38% that does. \u00a0 Secondly, Biden\u2019s main campaign pitches have proven hollow. Americans see Joe Biden unable to bring his own party together, much less the country. Progressives fault him for failing to push their agenda; moderates are wary of his extreme positions on racial equity, transgender rights, abortion and climate change.\u00a0 Third,  inflation and the Federal Reserve\u2019s response  means our economy is in real trouble for the first time in more than a decade. Recession looms, and job losses are beginning to mount. \u00a0 CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER Fourth,  there is the age issue.  The majority of Americans (64% in a recent poll) think Biden is too old to be president now, much less four years from now.\u202fThe deterioration in the president\u2019s mental acuity seems to be accelerating. \u00a0 Fifth, Biden has lost the Bernie Bros \u2014 the followers of the Democratic Socialist Vermont Senator who didn\u2019t show up in 2016, and who therefore elected Donald Trump. Progressives are furious that Biden has been unable to further their Draconian climate measures, that he has not rewritten our tax code to hobble the millionaires and billionaires that Sanders would like to eliminate, that the favoritism extended to minorities has been way too modest and that Biden has failed to rewrite our immigration laws.\u00a0 CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Meanwhile, Biden might not beat Trump. Though the New York Times poll cited earlier says he holds the advantage, other recent soundings show Biden losing to Trump. People may not like Donald J. Trump, but they were better off when he was president. \u00a0 How will Democrats stave off further disaster and keep Biden from running again?

NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!\n   The  school choice movement  is winning like never before, but government school defenders are doing all they can to protect their monopoly. In the wake of extended school shutdowns, second-rate Zoom school, and politicized classrooms, 19 states last year enacted 32 new or expanded education choice policies, making it \"The Year of Education Choice.\"\u00a0   Video The broadest new school choice policy enacted in 2021 was  West Virginia\u2019s Hope Scholarship , a K-12 education savings account (ESA) that empowers nearly all families, regardless of income, to take their children's state-funded education dollars to the education providers of their choosing, whether it be a public, charter, private or home school. All West Virginia students who are switching out of a public school or entering kindergarten are eligible to receive an ESA starting this fall.\u00a0 TENNESSEE GOVERNOR PUSHES LONG-BLOCKED SCHOOL VOUCHER PROGRAM \u2018IMMEDIATELY\u2019 On Thursday, Arizona went even further when Gov. Doug Ducey signed into law the nation\u2019s  most expansive education choice policy . Just over a decade ago, Arizona became the first state to offer ESAs, but the policy was initially limited to students with special needs. State lawmakers have repeatedly expanded eligibility, and now  every  K-12 student in Arizona will be eligible to receive an ESA.These are massive gains for American families, but supporters of school choice shouldn\u2019t let their understandable euphoria subside into complacency. Defenders of the status quo are vigorously mounting a counteroffensive to delay, block and undo the choice reforms. We have entered the \" Empire Strikes Back \" phase of the fight for school choice.     \n      Republican Gov. Doug Ducey of Arizona speaks with Fox News at the National Governors Association's annual summer meeting, on July 13, 2022, in Portland, Maine\u00a0\n       (Fox News\u00a0) In West Virginia, union-funded opponents of choice immediately sued the state to block implementation of the ESA. On Wednesday, a trial court judge \u2013 who had been endorsed and funded by the teachers\u2019 unions \u2013 sided with the plaintiffs, declaring the ESAs unconstitutional and prohibiting the state from implementing the policy.\u00a0 More than 3,000 students had already signed up for ESAs, expecting to be able to use them during the next academic year. Now they are in limbo until the lawsuit is resolved. According to the judge, the state constitution\u2019s requirement that the legislature provide \"for a thorough and efficient system of free schools\" means that it can  only  pay for public schools and no more. But a plain reading of the text finds no such limitation. The requirement to do X does not imply a restriction from doing Y and Z in addition to X.     \n      West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey during his campaign for the U.S. Senate in 2018.\n       (Patrick Smith/Getty Images) West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey has already declared that his office will appeal the decision, which he called \"legally incorrect.\" He expects the state supreme court will reverse it.\u00a0 On the same day, the anti-school choice group Save Our Schools (SOS) of Arizona declared their intention to refer the ESA expansion to the ballot. If they can gather the requisite 119,000 valid signatures by Sept. 25, then the expansion will be put on hold for two years pending the results of the referendum during the 2024 election. SOS is apparently confident of stopping the expansion due to the success of their similar referendum, Prop 305, in 2018. In that referendum, Arizona voters rejected an expansion of the ESA by a nearly two-to-one margin.   Video Or did they? That\u2019s the narrative SOS wants people to believe, but the reality is much more complicated. Though voters resoundingly rejected Prop 305, their motives are murky.\u00a0 CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER Some major school choice groups, such as the American Federation for Children, also opposed Prop 305, albeit for a very different reason. Due to Arizona\u2019s Voter Protection Act, any policy enacted by the voters requires a three-fourths supermajority of the legislature to modify. That meant the proposition\u2019s cap of only 30,000 ESAs would, for all intents and purposes, be set in stone. It would have also made it nearly impossible to tweak the policy going forward.\u00a0 In other words, many voters opposed Prop 305 not because it went too far, but because it didn\u2019t go far enough.   Video This time is different. Arizona\u2019s recent ESA expansion does not limit the number of participating students, so national school choice groups are going to put up a fight. Additionally, public support for school choice has reached all-time highs following the COVID shutdowns. According to a recent Morning Consult poll, two-thirds of  Arizona citizens support ESAs , as do three-fourths of parents of school-aged children.\u00a0 CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Defenders of the government school empire in Arizona and West Virginia are afraid that if families get a taste of education choice, they won\u2019t want to give it up. It\u2019s easier to prevent them from exercising the ability to choose at the outset than to try to take that choice away later. Even opponents of school choice understand that, in the long run, they cannot stop its advance because families want more education options. All opponents can hope for is to slow it down. For the sake of all children \u2013 who need more options now \u2013 let us hope that they do not succeed.

In his piece, titled, \"I Was Wrong About Inflation,\" the economics professor noted that he was on \"Team Relaxed\" when it came to fears of inflation and acknowledged that was a \"very bad call.\" Krugman began by recounting the \"intense debate among economists about the likely consequences of the American Rescue Plan, the $1.9 trillion package enacted by a new Democratic president and a (barely) Democratic Congress.\" He mentioned how he originally didn\u2019t see the massive government spending bill as that dangerous for the economy. \"Some warned that the package would be dangerously inflationary; others were fairly relaxed. I was Team Relaxed. As it turned out, of course, that was a very bad call,\" he confessed. DEMOCRATIC HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER HOYER ADMITS INFLATION A 'HUGE PROBLEM'   Video Of course the columnist, who once insisted that President Biden would oversee a \" soaring, \u2018morning in America\u2019-type recovery ,\" claimed that he couldn\u2019t see how bad inflation would be because the \"debate and the way things have played out were more complicated than I suspect more people realize.\" Krugman stated that people on both sides of the debate knew inflation was coming, even him, though both sides disagreed on how much inflation would occur. \"Everyone in the debate agreed that deficit spending would stimulate demand; everyone agreed that a stronger economy with a lower unemployment rate would, other things equal, have a  higher inflation rate. \" \"What we had instead was an argument about magnitudes. The rescue plan was huge in dollar terms, and as Team Inflation warned, if it had a normal-size \u2018multiplier\u2019 (the increase in gross domestic product caused by a dollar of additional government spending) it would lead to a highly overheated economy,\" he explained.\u00a0 However, the way he and Team Relaxed saw it, \"the structure of the plan would lead to a much smaller surge in G.D.P. than the headline number would suggest\u2026 We also argued that if there were a temporary overshoot on G.D.P. and employment it wouldn\u2019t sharply increase inflation.\"\u00a0 Krugman defended this perspective, writing it is what \"historical experience\" would suggest.     \n      Inflation is currently at a 40-year-high.\n       (istock) Krugman maintained \"that the multiplier on the rescue plan does, in fact, seem to have been relatively low\" but \" inflation soared  anyway.\" Admitting his predictions failed him, he asked, \"Why?\" BIDEN UNDER FIRE FOR HYPING FALLING GAS PRICES, WHILE INFLATION GROWS Of course, he claimed that \"disruptions associated with the pandemic\" caused \"much\" of the inflation surge. \"People spent less money on services and more on goods, leading to shortages of shipping containers, overstressed port capacity, and so on. These disruptions help explain why inflation rose in many countries, not just in the United States.\" Still, he admitted that doesn\u2019t account for how inflation has spread. \"But while inflation was confined mainly to a relatively narrow part of the economy at first, consistent with the disruption story, it has gotten broader,\" he wrote, adding that \"historical experience wouldn\u2019t have led us to expect this much inflation from overheating.\" Again he claimed, perhaps \"disruptions associated with adjusting to the pandemic\" are still \"playing a large role\" and he also theorized that \"Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and China\u2019s lockdown of major cities\" have added to inflation.\u00a0 CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Either way, Krugman closed out his column with the remark that \"the whole experience has been a lesson in humility.\" He then offered one final rationalization for his error, claiming, \"Nobody will believe this, but in the aftermath of the 2008 crisis standard economic models performed pretty well, and I felt comfortable applying those models in 2021.\"\u00a0 \"But in retrospect I should have realized that, in the face of the new world created by Covid-19, that kind of extrapolation wasn\u2019t a safe bet,\" he concluded.     \n      New York Times columnist Paul Krugman admits he did not foresee how high inflation would become.\u00a0\n       (REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton/File Photo)     Gabriel Hays is an associate editor at Fox News.

The White House, in particular, has moved to frame the bill as a boon for national security.\u00a0 The Biden administration , meanwhile, has pushed hard for the passage of the bill.

Braidy Industries still needs to raise $500 million to build a long-promised $1.7 billion aluminum plant in Appalachia, a top company executive told Kentucky lawmakers on Tuesday, July 19, 2022.\u00a0\n       (AP Photo/Adam Beam, File) The Unity spokesperson did not immediately respond to the governor's remarks. In 2017, amid great fanfare, Braidy promised to build the plant near Ashland and hire 550 people. The project was hailed at the time by state and local officials. The Appalachian region has lost thousands of jobs amid deep declines in the coal industry and manufacturing. The company planned to have the mill open in 2020. But the company underwent a management shakeup and name change in its long and ultimately unsuccessful quest to raise sufficient capital to proceed. KENTUCKY POLICE ASKING FOR HELP TO NAME THEIR BULLDOG MASCOT Now, Steel Dynamics' plans for the mill are much larger in size and scope than what Unity had contemplated. And that could potentially deliver the final setback for the Ashland area's hopes. The Steel Dynamics mill is expected to produce nearly double the volume of aluminum than the original proposal for the Kentucky site, the Unity spokesperson has said. Steel Dynamics also hopes customers will locate operations at the mill site to save money. The Ashland-area site \u2014 about 240 acres (97 hectares) \u2014 is \"insufficient to meet the size and scope requirements\" of the new project, the Unity spokesperson told The Associated Press on Wednesday. Steel Dynamics has not responded to emails asking about that Kentucky site. Steel Dynamics has said its estimated $2.2 billion project includes two supporting aluminum slab centers to be built elsewhere. Commercial production is planned to begin in early 2025. Unity will have a small ownership stake in the new project, its spokesperson has said. Beshear said Thursday that the Ashland-area site will be developed, one way or another. \"Either we are going to get Steel Dynamics to come here, or we\u2019re going to get that property back,\" he said. \"We could have located multiple opportunities on that property by now.\" Kentucky Senate President Robert Stivers  said he hopes the new mill venture will be a success. \"More importantly, we want to see Kentucky be a beneficiary,\" the Republican Senate leader said in a statement Thursday. \"For that reason, we remain optimistic and encourage the administration to do its best and fully engage in retaining the project.\" KENTUCKY GOV. ANDY BESHEAR UPDATES EFFORTS TO OVERCOME MARION WATER SHORTAGE Beshear already has landed the state\u2019s two largest-ever economic development projects \u2014 both related to battery production for electric vehicles. Kentucky last year posted records for job creation and investments and on Thursday posted its lowest-ever unemployment rate \u2014 3.7% in June.    "},

A whopping 50 million vehicles on the road have open recalls. Thousands of Fords, Nissans, Hyundais and Hondas were recently added to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's list.\n       (AP\u00a0) 1. Find your car\u2019s VIN \u00a0 The first step is to find your vehicle\u2019s 17-digit Vehicle Identification Number, or VIN, for short.\u00a0 The VIN is found on most vehicles by standing outside the front windshield and peering down at the lower driver\u2019s side corner of the dashboard. It can be a little hard to see, so look carefully. Some cars also have it printed on an emblem on the driver-side door jamb.\u00a0 If you can\u2019t locate your car\u2019s VIN, check your vehicle title or registration, or look in your insurance documents.\u00a0 By the way, it's wise to take a photo of your car's VIN, so you always have it handy.  Tap or click for 9 more photos you should always have on your phone. \u00a0\u00a0 Want my security and safety alerts right to your inbox?  Try my free newsletters here. \u00a0 2. Update your registration \u00a0 Make sure your car's manufacturer can reach you. That means keeping your registration up to date and ensuring your current address is on file. Yes, you may hear about a serious recall through a letter in the mail.\u00a0 Your first stop is checking your vehicle. Look at the registration sticker in the corner of your plate to make sure the marked year is current. You can also visit your state motor vehicle department\u2019s website to see whether you need to pay any fees or go through emissions testing to bring your paperwork current.\u00a0     \n      Woman mechanic\n       (iStock) More helpful resources:  10 tech company customer service phone numbers plus a secret way to know wait times \u00a0 3. Use the NHTSA recall checkup tool \u00a0 Once you have your VIN, visit the  National Highway Traffic Safety Administration\u2019s (NHTSA) recall lookup page . Enter your VIN into the provided search field, and the results will show the number and type of safety recalls that apply to your specific vehicle. (If you don't have your VIN, try searching for your car's year, make and model instead.)\u00a0 The search tool includes unrepaired vehicle safety recalls from the past 15 calendar years. You\u2019ll also see vehicle safety recalls from major light auto automakers, motorcycle manufacturers and some medium/heavy truck manufacturers.\u00a0 Suppose you don't get any results; good news! Your vehicle is not part of a current recall.\u00a0 Pro tip:  It\u2019s also a good idea to search the VIN when you buy a used car to know if you will need to deal with any safety issues after taking ownership.\u00a0 Aside from car recalls, the NHTSA's site is good for checking for recalls on vehicle accessories like car seats, tires and other car-related equipment.\u00a0 Scammers are going after drivers just like you.

Be proactive \u00a0 Just because your vehicle isn\u2019t currently subject to recall doesn\u2019t mean it won\u2019t get one in the future. For that purpose, the  NHTSA also offers an email notification system  to receive alerts about recalls. To sign up, enter your email address, and choose up to five vehicle models, makes and years. You can also choose to get an overview of all vehicle recalls each week and whether to receive alerts about tire or car seat recalls.\u00a0 The NHTSA site is also an excellent spot to compare vehicle safety ratings, check your tires and find out how easy a car seat is to use.

On CNN\u2019s \"Fareed Zakaria GPS,\" Zakaria spoke with Summers on the upcoming release of America\u2019s second quarter GDP data next week. With the first quarter GDP showing economic contraction, he asked Summers whether he believes there\u2019s a  chance of a recession. \"I think there is a very high likelihood of recession. When we\u2019ve been in this kind of situation before, recession has essentially always followed. When inflation has been high and unemployment has been low, soft landings represent a kind of triumph of hope over experience. I think we\u2019re very unlikely to see one,\" Summers said.

Over a year ago, I warned representatives on the House Committee on Oversight and Reform about the inflationary effects of reckless government spending and the proposed Green New Deal. A few of the Democrats attending the hearing listened attentively, but others outright dismissed my warnings as partisan theater (Rep. Ocasio-Cortez, D-NY, remarked in response to my warning\u00a0\"[A]nother day, another line about Green New Deal hysteria\")\u00a0 I of course was not alone in issuing these warnings because the likely outcome of the spending and energy policies enacted and proposed by the current Congress and President Joe Biden were obvious. Larry Summers, treasury secretary under President Bill Clinton, and someone President Barack Obama considered as a possible Federal Reserve chair,\u00a0warned\u00a0that Biden\u2019s $2 Trillion spending plan would have dire consequences.\u00a0 \u00a0 I am a man of modest intellect who has been blessed with an outstanding education. As a part of that education, I learned the law of supply and demand. If the demand for a good is higher than the supply of that good the price will rise. Democrats borrowed money and gave it to consumers who weren\u2019t working (producing) and so demand for goods grew faster than production of goods. At the same time, Democrats implemented policies that intentionally limited the supply of oil and gas when the demand for oil and gas was as high as it\u2019s ever been. High demand across an economy with low supply across an economy leads to higher prices.\u00a0\u00a0 INFLATION WILL SOON BE HIGHER THAN BIDEN'S APPROVAL RATING: SOUTH DAKOTA GOV.

Government spending buys votes.  Congress is incentivized  to spend as much as it can borrow and then kind of just hope for the best, even in the face of warnings from important folks like Summers and well-meaning though less important folks like me.\u00a0 We can change that today.\u00a0 Across the government there are benefits tied (in a positive direction) to inflation through the consumer price index so that Americans are not punished for inflation. I propose we tie congressional salary (in a negative way) to inflation for the express purpose of punishing Congress for reckless economic policy. The process is more straightforward than one would think.\u00a0 The Federal Reserve has not established a formal inflation target, but their view is that\u00a0an acceptable inflation rate\u00a0is 2%\u00a0or a little below it. For the entire year following a recorded inflation rate above 2%, salaries for members of Congress should be adjusted for the following year to mirror the relative impact of inflation on poor and working-class Americans.\u00a0   Video A brief example will demonstrate:\u00a0\u00a0 Members of the House and Senate currently earn $174,000 per year. Our current inflation rate of 9.1% translates to an impact on a poor family of $5,000 or 25% of that family\u2019s income. Member salary should be adjusted for the remainder of the fiscal year to $130,500 (a 25% pay reduction) so that member circumstances reflect the people\u2019s circumstances and members live with the result of their policies. \u00a0 Logistically, the change only requires that the Treasury Department determine if the first quarter rate of inflation is above 2%, if so, how much, and what the effect is on poor American families, all information that Treasury currently collects. Congress is already subject to\u00a0automatic pay adjustments, and Congress was originally paid on a per diem, so the logistics here are manageable by comparison.\u00a0 \"But Shay\" you may ask, \"what about the Members of Congress who don\u2019t support reckless policies, should they be punished?\" My answer is that those members need to do a better job of convincing, opposing, or cooperating with the majority to produce rational economic policy.\u00a0     \n      The chamber of the House of Representatives is seen at the Capitol in Washington, Feb. 28, 2022.

NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!\n   The rise of global \"Environmental Social & Governance\" (ESG) is essentially mercantilism being disguised as environmental stewardship, and something Americans should be concerned about,  Heritage Foundation President Dr. Kevin Roberts  told Fox News Digital in a recent interview. In mercantilism, which was prominent during the Colonial era, nations sought to grow the state through regulation of certain economic sectors, as a means to compete in a global trade-based hierarchy, typified by the control Britain then exerted on American cotton and tobacco exports. Roberts cited the  recent government collapse in Sri Lanka , which had instituted bans on chemical fertilizers deemed environmentally unfriendly. The ban, among other factors, led to greatly decreased harvests, shortages and eventually unrest that caused Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa to resign and evacuate his Colombo palace earlier this year. \"There's a 100% correlation\" between pursuit of ESG goals and such instability, Roberts said. \"I actually think it's a version of mercantilism happening in the 21st century under the guise of environmental stewardship.\" DUTCH FARMERS FORM FREEDOM CONVOYS TO PROTEST GOVERNMENT'S STRICT ENVIRONMENTAL RULES     \n      Farmers gather with their vehicles next to a Germany/Netherlands border sign during a protest on June 29, 2022, against the Dutch government's nitrogen plans.\n       (Vincent Jannink/ANP/AFP via Getty) \"I hate that the people of Sri Lanka and the Netherlands are having to face the unrest and the financial concerns that they have. I don't wish that on anyone,\" he continued, adding that he and others have been sounding the alarm over ESG governance leading to implications such as that. He told Fox News Digital the E.U. and other governments in the developed world are, whether directly or indirectly, convincing countries like Sri Lanka to adopt ESG in hopes of receiving attention and, more importantly, financial support. \"[Government officials] from Europe in particular are very clear that the incentives\u2026 the European Union [and] major European governments talk about for developing countries like Sri Lanka are all oriented around those countries implementing the ESG agenda entirely,\" said Roberts.

Sri Lanka and the Netherlands boast an ESG score in the 90s, while the United States trails behind in that metric. In the Netherlands, farmers have been protesting their government over similar pro-ESG policies like nitrogen emission reductions they say threaten crop yields and therefore their own well-being. Holland is the second-largest food exporter besides the United States. That situation turned more serious earlier this month when  irate farmers aboard tractors  were fired upon by Dutch law enforcement. Roberts told Fox News Digital the Heritage Foundation has done research into the correlation between Dutch and Sri Lankan environmental policies and the unrest cropping up in both countries \u2013 and offered words of warning for the U.S. as President Biden and Democrats show favor for their similar \"Green New Deal\" platform.

And especially Dutch farmers are raising the flag\u2026 It is these examples are very telling examples of what the American future will look like in just years, not decades, if we continue any further down this path of implementing the Green New Deal.\" Roberts said he first learned about the ESG concept with the Obama-era Clean Power Plan, which sought to battle global warming through emission-reduction requirements, wherein states were to submit plans on how to achieve such goals. While President Donald Trump effectively helped end the plan in 2019, Roberts said some financial firms are themselves seeking to institute ESG practices by focusing on green investments. Just last week,  Biden announced  that he will be implementing a number of executive actions focused on combating climate change. The administration has stayed away from using the Green New Deal as the term for its aggressively green agenda.

But also we need positive legislative action by that presumed conservative majority next year to put to rest all of these threats about this federal government requiring ESG and publicly traded funds.\" \"I would like for Americans, as [Moore] pointed out, who have begun to equate ESG with environmental stewardship, to know that they are not at all the same thing \u2013 and that we can be morally upright stewards of nature; of what God has given us; and realize that ESG actually gets in the way of humans flourishing,\" Roberts concluded.

Yellen went on to say that a \"common definition\" for a recession is two consecutive quarters of negative GDP, and while economists expect to see negative growth again this quarter after seeing\u00a0-1.4% last quarter, that still wouldn\u2019t mean the U.S. is in a recession. \"Well, I look at all the data, and GDP will be closely watched,\" Yellen said. \"A common definition of recession is two negative quarters of GDP growth, or at least that\u2019s something that\u2019s been true in past recessions. When we have seen that, there has usually been a recession. And many economists expect second-quarter GDP to be negative. First-quarter GDP was negative, so we could see that happen, and that will be closely watched. But I do want to emphasize, what a recession really means is a broad-based contraction in the economy. And even if that number is negative, we are not in a recession now, and I would, you know, warn that we should be not characterizing that as a recession.\" Todd said Yellen was \"splitting hairs\" with her answer, but Yellen also pointed to the NBER's data.

NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!\n   In the 1870s Gustave Flaubert wrote the Dictionary of Received Ideas. The satirical work was meant to poke fun at the mores of France at the time. Its definitions are absurd, sometimes self-contradictory, and generally hilarious. Of late it has occurred to me that  the American left  has been laboring for years now on its own Dictionary of Received Ideas. In some cases words we have thought we\u2019ve known the meaning of for our whole lives have suddenly changed, in others new words appear like little green buds sprouting on a tower\u2019s ivy. But in any and all cases it is best to know what these words mean now, so that we can make better sense of progressives and understand why it is that they are always right and others always wrong.

Unless you are discussing abortion. Racism Racism is the foundational state of society, especially American and other Western societies. It was the primary and driving factor of the development of white society. Examples of racism can be overt, but also unintentional, such examples include, but are not limited to, cultural appropriation, failure to acknowledge one\u2019s privilege, and the existence of pretty much any statue erected before 1970. Latinx Latinx is a term meant to correct Hispanics\u2019 unintentional sexism in how they have referred to themselves for several hundred years. While apparently upwards of 97 percent of Hispanics don\u2019t use the term, and many have never even heard it, its use in political or academic contexts is a signal that whatever the person using it says must be true. Widely applicable, it can refer to a Dominican man, a Puerto Rican woman (see above) or a Corona. Human life A Human life begins at the exact moment that a fetus leaves the birth canal. The transformation from a mere clump of cells to a human life is instantaneous in that moment. No physical or mental characteristics existing prior to the moment of birth confer human life on a subject  in utero . This definition of life is specific to humans and does not define life in any other animal species.   Video Recession An  economic downturn once defined  as two straight quarters of negative gross domestic product growth, it is now defined in a more nuanced and broad manner, involving a range of metrics too complicated for you to understand but which will never rise to actual recession levels when a Democrat is president.

And what got us out of that recession were his lowering of tax rates and lowering regulations. That's what saved us from the recession that was meant to curb inflation.

Therefore, Joe Biden had to talk, so his aides dutifully let him out to the podium today to say something edifying about it. What happened next has got to be one of the weirdest presidential briefings ever conducted. \u00a0 New economic numbers show our GDP has declined for two quarters in a row. That's the definition of a recession. We're in a recession. That's why Joe Biden had to hold the briefing. And yet Biden never once mentioned those numbers, not a single time.

Watch. \u00a0 PRESIDENT BIDEN:  And let me speak to one other issue. Let me speak to one other issue, the GDP and whether or not we are in a recession. Both Chairman Powell and many of the significant banking personnel and economists say we're not in recession. Let me just give you what the facts are in terms of the state of the economy. Number one, we have a record job market of record unemployment of 3.6% today and the Inflation Reduction Act will add another $370 billion in clean energy tax credits in reconciliation, including incentives to accelerate domestic production of solar panels, wind turbines, batteries and critical materials processing. That doesn't sound like a recession to me.

Plus, wind turbines. Wind turbines and if you don't believe it, 3.6% unemployment. We are winning. Pay no attention to the millions of former workers who are being paid by the government to stay home, leaving businesses without anyone to staff them. Why is the ice cream stand near your house closed in July? Well, because welfare pays more than scooping ice cream does. But ignore that. The economy is in great shape.\u00a0 If there's one thing that might make it even better other than wind turbines, it's printing billions more in fake money, which will definitely not accelerate our already  terrifying level of inflation . That's why we're calling it the Inflation Reduction Act, because more money in the system will reduce inflation. It will, and it will because we say it will because what matters is not the way that things actually are, what matters are the words we use to describe things. \u00a0 We can change reality merely by calling it something else. If we call a man a woman, that's what she is. If we call an open border a secure border, that's what we have, and as you just saw, if we tell you that a collapsing economy is a robust economy, well, then it's time to celebrate our newfound prosperity and feel free to buy champagne on your EBT card. It's on us. It turns out that when you think you\u2019re God, all that matters is what you say, your commands. \"In the beginning was the Word\" and this week the word was definitely not \"recession.\"\u00a0 DEMOCRATS HOLD SLIGHT EDGE OVER GOP, ABORTION MORE IMPORTANT TO VOTERS THAN INFLATION, POLL SHOWS \u00a0 That word is now an operative. It's obsolete and frankly, it's embarrassing. It's like \"stewardess\" or \"fireman\" or \"the orient.\" It's not something you'd say are uneducated people. So, to herald this important new change to our language, on July 21st, the White House officially changed the definition of recession. They said it, so it's true now. In a blog post, officials explained that two consecutive quarters of declining GDP is \"neither the official definition nor the way economists evaluate the state of the business cycle.\" Not convinced? Well, you're not watching television because every official in the Biden administration, all these credentialed economists, went on camera to swear it was true. \u00a0 JANET YELLEN:\u00a0 I do want to emphasize what a recession really means is a broad-based contraction in the economy and even if that number is negative, we are not in a recession now.\u00a0 \u00a0 BRIAN DEESE:  And certainly, in terms of the technical definition, it's not a recession.

REUTERS/Evelyn Hockstein\n       (REUTERS/Evelyn Hockstein) Okay. So, ignore the tape of Janet Yellen. We shouldn't have played that. It's hard to think clearly. Ignore how mind bogglingly repulsive she is, ignore all the work she's done herself to destroy the American economy when she ran the Federal Reserve. Listen to what they're saying. Two consecutive quarters of declining GDP, that's not the definition of recession. Really? We thought it was. We thought that for about 50 years. Turns out we\u2019re insane. We're hallucinating. Lucy in the sky with diamonds stuff and the media have confirmed it. \u00a0 This is from Politico,: \"The White House is pretty obviously right that even two quarters of shrinking GDP would not show the economy is currently in recession.\" That's the word from Ben White, who is the chief economics reporter at Politico and he's backed up by the Associated Press, which is totally real. Just today, the AP reported that, \"The U.S. economy shrank for a second straight quarter, raising fears the nation may be approaching a recession.\"\u00a0 Oh, we're getting close now. In other words, two declining quarters of growth is not a recession, just like the White House said, and that sounds definitive. It's always been that way as long as you don't have a memory that extends past, say, last week, because it was a few weeks ago before the White House declared otherwise that everyone was saying differently, including Ben White and the AP. They were still using the term stewardess. They were using the old definition. Want examples? \u00a0 Okay, how about this? June 22nd of this year, this same Ben White, assuming he's real, wrote in Politico, which unfortunately is and we're quoting: \"I'm sorry to report that the conditions are ripe for a slide in gross domestic product growth that lasts at least two quarters, the technical definition of recession.\" Ooh, Ben White. Could that be the same Ben White, the same Politico? Could be. And then in January of this year, which is 2022, we think the AP reported the same thing, and we're quoting: \"Mexico's economy entered a technical recession at the end of last year with two consecutive quarters of contraction.\"\u00a0 WASHINGTON POST COLUMNIST DEFENDS BIDEN FROM ACCUSATION OF 'WHITE SUPREMACY' FOR WORKING WHILE SICK WITH COVID \u00a0 Oh, wow. So, it turns out that was the definition prior to two weeks ago. In fact, it's been the definition for decades. In fact, you'll find it in every economic textbook ever written. It's all over the archives of the AP, which because we're paid to do it, we slog through today. Here's one example. \"French economy falls back into recession,\" the AP reported back in 2013. Here's a direct quote from the article \"A recession is defined as two consecutive quarters of negative growth.\"\u00a0 Oh, you're not insane. No one dosed you. You're not hallucinating. Even CNN used to say this. As CNN White House correspondent John Harwood wrote on August 20th, 2019, back during Trump and Big Orange ran things no more quoting \"recession equals economy shrinks for two quarters.\" Oh, wow.\u00a0 In fact, not to belabor the point, even Brian Deese, who is now the top White House economic adviser, used to run with that definition and we're quoting \"economists have a technical definition of recession, which is two consecutive quarters of negative growth.\" He wrote that back in 2008. Unfortunately for him, we found it and yet this week, everything's different because you can't say stewardess is anymore. So, this is new position is \"two negative quarters of GDP growth is not the technical definition of recession.\".\u00a0 Wow. Okay. If you say so, because in the beginning was the word\u00a0you are god now, but that does raise the question, if it's not a recession, then what is it? Well, for this and all other important matters, including intimate marital questions, we go to the White House press secretary who informs us it's not a recession. It's \"a transition.\" \u00a0 REPUBLICANS DENY BALLOONING SPENDING UNDER TRUMP CAUSED INFLATION \u00a0   Video JEAN-PIERRE:   When you look at it more broadly at the data and that's why what we're seeing is that we are in a transition. \u00a0 We're in a \"transition.\" Does that mean the whole country is now taking puberty blockers and becoming a girl? No, different kind of transition. This is a transition to green energy and renewables. Joe Biden announced today say it's a transition to handing China our energy grid. Oh, that's a transition. Some might call it a collapse of empire in a subsequent disaster where we're ruled by people who hate us. But no, it's a transition in which China gets to making control the wind turbines, the lithium, the solar panels. Hmm. \u00a0 What do actual voters think about this. Who cares cause that only matters in a democracy, but we'll tell you anyway. Americans do not want to hand our energy grid to China or stop using air conditioning in the summer or drive your stupid little electric cars. Right. Because it turns out no one believes the experts who have told us the world is going to end for the past 50 years, but who still buy beachfront property. \u00a0 BIDEN-XI CALL LASTS MORE THAN 2 HOURS; BEIJING WARNED THE US NOT TO 'PLAY WITH FIRE' ON TAIWAN \u00a0 Paging you, Barack Obama and most people kind of understand what's going to happen next. They could become Sri Lanka, a country that destroyed itself, committed national suicide in pursuit of a high ESG score. Turns out actual people of both parties, just all normal people, want to do things like afford gasoline or have someplace to live they can afford. \u00a0 What Joe Biden said today will get us much closer to Sri Lanka. There's kind of no dispute about that. We also know for certain that the spending under the Biden administration, under previous administrations, but certainly dramatically accelerated under Biden has devalued the dollar to the point that we have massive inflation and a decline in GDP, because as money loses value and things get more expensive, people at some point can't afford to buy as much and then gross domestic product declines.\u00a0 It's not like some crazy theory. In fact, even the Fed Reserve Bank of San Francisco, hardly a right-wing institution, has pointed out that Joe Biden's spending in his first year in office singlehandedly hiked the inflation rate by at least 3%. That's higher than many other developed countries, including Germany, Canada and the UK. So, what's been the effect for the rest of us? Now, they can say there's no recession and the word is like \"fireman,\" you just don't say it, but what's America look like? Well, I don't know. Let\u2019s check your local food bank.\u00a0 NYC BODEGA OWNER CALLS OUT BIDEN ADMIN OVER RAMPANT INFLATION: 'WE'RE NOT GETTING THE SUPPORT THAT WE SHOULD' \u00a0   Video There is a good chance your local food bank is overwhelmed. In Boise, Idaho, for example, the Meridian Foodbank reports they've gone from serving 2,800 people every month to 4,200 in just the last year. Another nearby food bank called the Care House Food Bank has reported a similar increase. A spokesman for the Care House told a local news station, \"We're finding out that with the rising rent costs and the rising gasoline costs, the rent each first, the gasoline eats second. So, the family has very little to buy food to eat.\"\u00a0 Sounds like a rich country to you, a place that's thriving, that can afford to turn its energy grid over to China? No. It's the same story across the country. Allentown, Pennsylvania\u2014the Allentown Area Ecumenical Food Bank reports a massive increase in families who need food. In the biggest food producing country in the world? Yeah, that's us, but still, the food banks director told the local news station there, \"Since October, we've tripled the number of families we're serving every month.\" She added, 300 of the 18,00 families she served this month are first time visitors. They haven't spent years at the food bank. They need to now because the economy is in, sorry to use the word, recession. \u00a0 Outside St Mary's Food Bank in Phoenix, the AP reported that hundreds of families lined up this month. The line went around the block. The food bank\u2019s main distribution center served 4,271 families in just one week last month. That's a 78% increase compared to last year. According to the AP, \"More than 900 families line up at the distribution center every weekday for an emergency government food box stuffed with goods such as canned beans, peanut butter and rice.\" That's a breadline, by the way. That's a breadline in the United States. Did you see that on NBC Nightly News? Probably not. It was happening everywhere.\u00a0 HILLARY CLINTON'S FORMER CHIEF STRATEGIST REVEALS WHY MANCHIN'S INFLATION BILL WON'T AFFECT MIDTERMS \u00a0 Alameda Foodbank in California, similar numbers. They've gone from 890 households served on a typical Friday in January to more than 1,400 families on a typical Friday last month. In central Florida, the Second Harvest Food Bank, which supplies around 500 food bank partners in the region, says the number of people looking for food, not for vacations in Antigua or a new Tesla, but for food to eat so they can survive, has gone up 25% in the last month.\u00a0 The food bank used to distribute 150,000 meals overall a day. Now they're up to a quarter million and that number is rising. The food bank\u2019s director says the cause is inflation. Obviously, \"it costs quite a bit to put millions and millions of pounds of food out the door every week and every month.\" Tell that to a local news station. So, does the White House notice any of this? Do they know what's happening? Who knows what they know. They certainly don't care. They're saying it out loud.\u00a0 Joe Biden's top economic adviser, Brian Deese, is telling you that it doesn't matter. You're worried about inflation? Well, it's easy for Americans to find food, says Brian Deese. Watch.\u00a0 BRIAN DEESE:  The United States is in a stronger position to actually train our focus on tackling inflation than virtually any other country. For example, you know, with respect to our food, we're a net exporter of agricultural commodities and obviously, the high prices are hitting Americans very hard, but in a way that is different from some places that are facing famine, for example. \u00a0 GREEN NEW DEAL DEMOCRATS CHANGE TUNE ON JOE MANCHIN AFTER $433 BILLION CLIMATE, INFLATION BILL \u00a0     \n      White House economic adviser Brian Deese was asked about the Biden administration's plan for inflation during CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" on Tuesday. \u00a0REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque\u00a0\n       (REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque) Oh, lower your expectations of America. That sound you're hearing is the goalposts moving. So, we went very quickly now from \"Build Back Better\" to \"Hey, at least you're not starving to death at least from a famine.\" Well, hold on a second, Powell. This was America like a year and a half ago where the planes took off on time and people were getting killed every day on the subway and there wasn't filth and graffiti and drug addicts on the streets and people weren't worried about having enough to eat. \u00a0 Those were our first world expectations, like electricity in the summertime. Oh, but there's no famine. Just be glad there's no famine and do your part, they're telling us, to save us from the climate crisis, one that somehow isn't affecting oceanfront property in Malibu and Martha's Vineyard, but not just the climate crisis to save democracy in Ukraine. Way more important than inflation, your stupid economic concerns. \u00a0 Just the other day, the president of Ukraine, Zelenskyy, the man they're telling us is the new George Washington, decided, you know what, I don't have to pretend to care about the United States anymore. I think Americans are ridiculous, decadent, overfed and I have contempt for them. So, he was asked, wait a second, \"Can America afford to send $60 billion to your corrupt autocracies so you can shoot dramatic magazine photo covers for Vogue?\"\u00a0 SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM ASKS CBO IF MANCHIN'S 'RECKLESS' $433 BILLION BILL WILL WORSEN INFLATION \u00a0 Well, of course, said Zelenskyy and we're quoting \"inflation, who's thinking about inflation? We're fighting for absolute communal values.\" \u00a0 \u00a0 What? Whose values? We're not in anything communal with you, pal. You run a corrupt little Eastern European country. We have a right to worry about our own country and yet, the White House, they agree with Zelenskyy. That's almost word for word what our national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, said when he was asked the exact same question on July 22nd. Americans are worried about sending all this money to Ukraine at a time when inflation is out of control and Americans don't have enough money, I don't know, to buy food or pay rent. So, the moderator at the Aspen Institute, which needs a lot more immigrants from the Third World immediately, as we told you tonight, asked this and you know what Jake Sullivan said fundamentally, I don't care. Watch this. \u00a0 MODERATOR:  Do you worry about criticism that we're spending billions and billions of dollars toward Ukraine not spending it here? \u00a0 BIDEN SAYS US NOT IN A RECESSION DESPITE TWO CONSECUTIVE QUARTERS OF SHRINKING ECONOMY \u00a0 \u00a0   Video JAKE SULLIVAN:  I t's my job to worry, so I worry about literally everything. I worry about my answer to this question. So, yes, I guess I worry, but in a way that's sort of not saying anything at all.\u00a0 MODERATOR:  I mean, this is the John Malkovich portion of the of our session. \u00a0 SULLIVAN: \u00a0But fundamentally, no. Congress passed a $40 billion package for Ukraine. Is the reservoir of support in this country as translated into the  Congress and the executive branch , deep and sustainable from the point of view of doing whatever it takes for, as the president has said, as long as it takes? Yes.\u00a0 CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \u00a0 So, here you have Jake Sullivan and Jeff Goldberg, two midwits who have accomplished pretty much nothing in their entire lives, talking about the issues that will define this country for our grandchildren before an audience in Aspen and saying things like, \"I'm not worried at all\" and then the audience titters and you wonder and historians will review tapes like that when they try to figure out what actually happened to this thriving civilization we had, you wonder if these people can hear themselves. Do they know how they look? Do they know how ridiculous they are? Do they know how deeply the public despises them for good reason? \u00a0 \"Do you worry about criticism, we're setting billions of dollars for Ukraine and not spending it here?\" \"Fundamentally, no,\" and Jake Sullivan isn't worried because he knows he can call inflation transitory when it's not. He can deny we're in recession when we're obviously in one because the words are all that matter to them, not the reality.\u00a0 They don't walk through midtown in Manhattan and notice, \"Hey, this is disgusting. This is worse than Mumbai. How did it get this way?\" They don't even notice.

Va., reversing course on his support of a reconciliation package on \u2018Your World.\u2019 NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!\n   New York Times columnist Paul Krugman continued to push an optimistic view of the economy in the face of recent news on Thursday. The latest gross domestic product (GDP) report released in the morning revealed that the economy contracted by .9%. This marked the second consecutive quarter that the economy experienced negative growth, signaling a recession. However, the White House and several media pundits have been  redefining the term recession  to insist it doesn\u2019t mean two consecutive quarters of negative growth. Krugman, who also suggested the U.S. is not in recession, reiterated that claim in his column. \"The U.S. economy is not currently in a recession. No, two quarters of negative growth aren\u2019t, whatever you may have heard, the \u2018official\u2019 or \u2018technical\u2019 definition of a recession; that determination is made by a committee that has always relied on several indicators, especially job growth. And as Jerome Powell, the chair of the Federal Reserve, noted yesterday, the labor market still looks strong,\" Krugman wrote. PAUL KRUGMAN INSISTS \u2018WE WON\u2019T BE\u2019 IN A RECESSION AFTER ADMITTING HE WAS WRONG TO DISMISS INFLATION CONCERNS \u00a0     \n      NYT columnist Paul Krugman admitted that he was \"wrong\" about his initial inflation reports.\n       (Ricardo Rubio/Europa Press via Getty Images)) Although Krugman admitted that the economy is \"definitely slowing,\" he claims that other reports have been \"fairly encouraging lately.\"\u00a0 For example, he highlighted the falling gas prices as a sign that the economy could be turning around, despite prices still topping $4 per gallon nationally. In addition, he noted that early predictions are suggesting that \"broader inflation\" could lessen in the coming quarter. \"As I suggested, early indications are that the Fed is winning its war on inflation, and doing so faster and more easily than most observers expected,\" Krugman wrote. This came despite  Krugman previously admitting  that he was \"wrong\" about inflation after June\u2019s report found the inflation rate increased by 9.1%, a new high. He instead acknowledged that it\u2019s \"much, much too soon to declare victory in the fight against inflation\" while noting there have been \"several false dawns\" over the last 18 months.     \n      New York Times headline says GDP numbers are \"fanning recession fears.\"\n       (Screenshot/NewYorkTimes) Moreover, he claimed that the largest impact felt by inflation was not the economic effect but the failure to pass meaningful climate change reform. \"That said, for a while it looked as if a bout of inflation had done permanent, even catastrophic damage via the political process, because it had undermined the prospects for meaningful action on climate change. An episode of high inflation isn\u2019t the end of the world; failure to act on climate might well be,\" Krugman wrote. WAPO, NY TIMES, CNN, ASSOCIATED PRESS AND MORE FRAME SECOND QUARTER GDP NUMBERS AS FUELING \u2018RECESSION FEARS\u2019 \u00a0 Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., has previously been reluctant to agree to any green agenda put forth by the Democrats, citing concerns with the inflation rate as a reason. However, on Wednesday, he officially announced an  agreement with Senate Democrats  on a reconciliation bill that would include $433 billion in climate initiatives. Despite economic fears, both Manchin and Krugman insisted that the bill will actually reduce inflation. \"So while the preliminary number for G.D.P. (which will probably be heavily revised) was negative, from where I sit the overall economic news looks fairly positive,\" Krugman closed.     \n      The recent GDP report found the economy shrank by .9% and previously shrinking last quarter, signaling the start of a recession.\u00a0\n       (i-stock) CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP In a piece published hours before the GDP report, Politico similarly insisted that the negative news could be \"heavily revised\" later while the current report  was probably \"inaccurate.\"     Lindsay Kornick is an associate editor for Fox News Digital.

If you've got two quarters in a row of the economy shrinking, you've got an economic problem.

It's been here for six months,\" he said. \"So it's not that people's fears are getting stoked because you're telling them about things coming. People already know.

And, that's really, you know, taken away from the fact that this jobs market is still relatively strong and wages are still relatively good. But, you know, it doesn't matter if your wages are good, if everything's more expensive.\" The recession news came the same week the Federal Reserve hiked interest rates 75 basis points for a second straight month, in an effort to cool down the economy and the record inflation hurting Americans. Flynn said  Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell , who like the rest of the Biden administration seemed caught off-guard by inflation that's dogged the U.S. for a year, seemed hopeful the recession would be temporary. \"He's hopeful that the recession is mild,\" Flynn said. \"And if that's the case, then the Fed's going to look a lot smarter, I mean, in a few weeks. But if things start getting worse, you know, if we start seeing layoffs, if we start seeing, you know, companies like Walmart that are saying that earnings are bad or Target or some of these other firms start to lay off workers, that could put a real scare in the economy. We could get a much deeper recession, and the Fed can't do anything about the government spending, right?\" The semantic battles over the term \"recession\" are secondary to how Americans actually feel, Flynn argued, and  polls repeatedly show  Americans list high prices and the economy as their chief concern.\u00a0 CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"I don't think they teach economics in school the way they used to, and I don't think the average American cares, you know, what the technical definition of a recession is,\" he said. \"They don't.

And finally, you have this huge volume of spending, which, I thought there was an agreement in Washington that too much spending  causes higher inflation . Tax hikes are going to cause a worse recession. If you guys can figure out the economic logic of this, please come on my show and explain it to me, because I don't get it.

NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!\n   Ever since the Biden administration attempted to redefine what a recession was ahead of this week's economic contraction news, numerous media outlets have embraced the  White House's  talking points. Now, there are individual journalists who are abandoning the traditional definition they previously espoused.\u00a0 The Commerce Department revealed this week that the U.S. economy has suffered two consecutive quarters of negative gross domestic product (GDP) growth, which has long been the measure of a recession, but several Biden officials have asserted that only the National Bureau of Economic Research's Business Cycle Dating Committee can determine whether the U.S. economy is in a recession, based on a multitude of factors that can only be found several months or up to a year after a recession actually begins. Politico's chief economic correspondent  Ben White  incorporated the spin in his report Thursday, claiming the new data is \"offering Republicans a tantalizing opportunity to declare that the economy under President Joe Biden is now in a recession.\" \"The report from the Commerce Department on gross domestic product over the April-June period (0.9 percent) followed a first-quarter decline of 1.6 percent and meets one \u2014 though far from the only \u2014 criteria for an economic recession. The figure is a first estimate and subject to future revisions,\" White wrote. \"But Republicans are poised to cast aside all the economic technicalities and bash Democratic candidates up and down the midterm ballot over an economy that is already deeply unpopular with voters in both parties.\"\u00a0 BIDEN WHITE HOUSE TALKING POINTS REDEFINING RECESSION QUICKLY EMBRACED BY MEDIA OUTLETS     \n      NEW YORK, NY - SEPTEMBER 18: Ben White, Chief Economic Correspondent, POLITICO, speaks at The 2017 Concordia Annual Summit at Grand Hyatt New York on September 18, 2017 in New York City. \u00a0(Photo by Paul Morigi/Getty Images for Concordia Summit)\n       (Paul Morigi/Getty Images\u00a0) On the eve of the economic report, White offered a defense of the Biden administration, tweeting, \"The White House is pretty obviously right that even two quarters of shrinking GDP would not show the economy is currently in recession.\" Except that's not what White believed just last month when he wrote in a Politico newsletter, \"I\u2019m sorry to report that the conditions are ripe for a slide in gross domestic product growth that lasts at least two quarters, the technical definition of recession.\" POLITICO DECLARES BIDEN \u2018BACK IN THE GAME\u2019 AS US ENTERS A RECESSION Additionally, in the early weeks of the coronavirus pandemic, White tweeted, \"IHS just downgraded first quarter growth to -2.1% others are also going negative. The second quarter will be down by double digits. All of this just means we are in a recession right now.\" Responding to critics on Thursday, White said his original analysis was a \"bad tweet a while ago\" and he \"should have known better at the time.\"\u00a0 White's newfound explainer of what a recession is and his defense of the Biden administration was accepted by MSNBC host Stephanie Ruhle, who tweeted, \"Good read Thank you.\" In addition to endorsing the White House spin, Ruhle downplayed the dire financial conditions, insisting the U.S. has a \"complicated economy\" rather than a \"bad\" one.\u00a0 NBC BUSINESS ANALYST SAYS ECONOMY IS \u2018COMPLICATED\u2019 NOT \u2018BAD\u2019 But in 2019, the NBC business analyst was able to offer a more straightforward definition of a recession. \"A recession is just two consecutive quarters of economic decline,\" Ruhle told then-MSNBC host Brian Williams.\u00a0     \n      MSNBC host Stephanie Ruhle argued the current economy is \"complicated\" instead of good or bad.\n       (Photo by Dia Dipasupil/Getty Images for Tribeca Festival) CNN White House correspondent John Harwood has been on a retweeting binge of people dismissing the \"technical\" definition of a recession. In addition to Ben White's tweet, Harwood shared a tweet from  New York Times  columnist Paul Krugman, who wrote \"Many news reports saying we've entered a 'technical recession' \u2014 which doesn't exist. Here's [Goldman Sachs]: \u2018the official definition of recession is a judgmental mix of levels and rates-of-change across several variables, most of which continued to expand in the first half of the year.'\" CNN'S VAN JONES PRAISES BIDEN'S \u2018SUCCESSFUL\u2019 PRESIDENCY \u2018IF YOU JUST ERASE THE PAST SIX MONTHS OF NUTTY STUFF\u2019 He shared another from economist Mark Zandi, who tweeted \"There was no recession in H1 of the year, the two consecutive quarterly GDP declines notwithstanding, but recession in the coming year looks increasingly tough to avoid\" as well as Marc Goldwein of the Committee for Responsible Federal Budget, who wrote \"1) no, 2 quarters of negative economic growth does not mean we\u2019re in a recession 2) just because we\u2019re not in a recession, doesn\u2019t mean the economy is doing great \u2014- it\u2019s not.\"     \n      CNN White House correspondent John Harwood went viral for a 2019 tweet declaring \"recession = economy shrinks for two quarters.\"\n       (Getty Images) Harwood himself, however, tweeted in 2019, \"btw it\u2019s not possible for a recession to last only two months recession = economy shrinks for two quarters.\" PAUL KRUGMAN INSISTS \u2018WE WON\u2019T BE' IN A RECESSION AFTER ADMITTING HE WAS WRONG TO DISMISS INFLATION CONCERNS He went even further in March 2020, telling CNN's Don Lemon, \"Even if we don\u2019t have two consecutive quarters of negative growth, we might have one quarter of growth so deep that it\u2019s classified as a recession.\" Earlier in the week, the Associated Press published an \"EXPLAINER\" on when to know a recession has begun, telling readers, \"By one common definition, the U.S. economy is on the cusp of a recession. Yet that definition isn\u2019t the one that counts.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"On Thursday, when the government estimates the gross domestic product for the April-June period, some economists think it may show that the economy shrank for a second straight quarter. That would meet a longstanding assumption for when a recession has begun,\" AP reporter Christopher Rugaber wrote Monday. \"But economists say that wouldn\u2019t mean that a recession had started. During those same six months when the economy might have contracted, businesses and other employers added a prodigious 2.7 million jobs \u2014 more than were gained in most entire years before the pandemic. Wages are also rising at a healthy pace, with many employers still struggling to attract and retain enough workers.\" But in January 2022, the AP was quick to declare a recession for the country of Mexico, writing \"Mexico\u2019s economy entered a technical recession at the end of last year with two consecutive quarters of contraction.\"     Joseph A.

Gretchen Whitmer's COVID shutdowns  on the state with a series of actions aimed at improving its economy and education system. In an exclusive interview with Fox News Digital ahead of Tuesday's primary, the longtime businessman slammed Whitmer over the damage he said she caused Michigan's businesses, outlined his plans to revitalize the state's business climate and argued he is the candidate in a crowded Republican field with the best chance to  win in November . \"Gov.

It seems like they're actually talking with each other, not only praising the president when he obviously is not doing well, but also, as you mentioned, redefining words like recession and woman, even to the point of contradicting what they've reported before. So I think this is a poor attempt by media outlets to try to make the American people think that the pain that they're feeling is not as bad as they think.

NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!\n   It didn't take long. It took, well, about a year and a half for the Biden administration to destroy the American economy and drive this nation into a recession. Now, the Biden administration won't admit that  we're in a recession . In fact, they've actually redefined the word \"recession\" just as they've redefined the words \"democracy,\" \"racism\" and \"woman,\" but you don't need to know what the word is to know what is happening. If you live here, you see it every single day. \u00a0 We're in a recession. The economy has been shrinking all year. Real wages are at record lows and at the same time, inflation is the highest it's been in the lifetime of most Americans. So, call it whatever you want, but it's a recession and it's scary and they're ignoring it. We're going to spend the next hour investigating how exactly this happened. How did they tank the economy so fast and what does it mean?\u00a0 To get to the answers to those questions, we're going to speak to people who have actual credibility on economics and that emphatically does not include our most highly credentialed economists, people who, like the public health experts we've watched the last two and a half years, have thoroughly beclowned and discredited themselves.\u00a0 A year ago, right about the time he told us that vaccines will absolutely prevent you from getting or transmitting COVID, Joe Biden was asked about, \"Hey, what happens if we go into a recession?\" In response, as he invariably does, Joe Biden invoked highly credentialed experts. Watch this.\u00a0 CLAIMS OF A BIDEN COMEBACK IN THE MEDIA? 'THE FIVE' RESPONDS \u00a0 PRESIDENT BIDEN:  We also know that as our economy has come roaring back. We see some price increases. Some folks have raised worries that this could be a sign of persistent inflation, but that's not our view. Our experts believe, and the data shows, that most of the price increases we've seen were expected and are expected to be temporary.\u00a0     \n      President Biden speaks about inflation and supply chain issues in Los Angeles.\u00a0\n       (AP Photo/Damian Dovarganes) Every word read off a teleprompter. A decade from now, we're going to see tape like that and think, \"I cannot believe that man was the president of the United States.\" But consider what his handlers wrote for him. The experts Biden was referring to are, in fact, some of the most well-credentialed figures in all of academic economics. In fact, two months later, in September of last year, 17 winners of the Nobel Prize in Economics signed a letter urging Joe Biden to spend as much money as possible and we're quoting \"The Build Back Better package,\" they wrote, \"will transform the U.S. economy to be more efficient without presenting an inflationary threat.\"\u00a0 So, go ahead and spend more money, create it out of thin air, print it and there's no chance you'll get inflation. Winners of the Nobel Prize in Economics said that. If you took Econ 101, you're laughing at that.\u00a0 By the way, it wasn't just them. The chairman of the  Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell , said the same thing. \"The incoming data are very consistent with the view that inflation will move down toward our goals,\" Powell said. \u00a0 It's like idiotic, and it turned out not to be true. Now, the remarkable thing, the way you know this isn't simply incompetence, they did this on purpose, is what happened when these so-called experts were exposed as frauds, which they are. Not a single one of these eminent Nobel Prize-winning economists ever apologized for the letter they wrote or even explained how they got it wrong. They're still saying the same thing \u2014 spend more money, and it won't affect inflation because when you have much more of something, it's worth the same.\u00a0 BIDEN ADMIN QUIETLY APPROVES CONSTRUCTION OF U.S.-MEXICO BORDER WALL NEAR YUMA, ARIZONA \u00a0 Oh, because supply and demand isn't real. They're all saying this to the extent they're even paying attention. Most of them aren't. They're way off into lifestyle liberal-land, like they all are. They're worried about trans rights. The St .Louis Fed, for example, one of the most important financial institutions in the United State, one of the banks that make up the central bank, they've been conducting studies about what? About what monetary policy would be best to avoid complete economic collapse? Well, you'd think so. That's their job, but that's not what they've been doing. \u00a0 Instead, for the past month, (We're not making this up) the St. Louis Fed has been meditating on equity, a term that no one can really define, but clearly means your life, Mr. and Mrs. American, is about to get much worse. \u00a0 So, just as Joe Biden audibly took office, equity is now the top priority of the Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis. Again, books will be written about this years from now and no one believe it actually happened, but it's real. Take a look at their website. Some of the top articles on the website, on the blog of the St. Louis Fed include, \"Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Access to COVID-19 Relief,\" \"COVID-19 Disruption by race, Ethnicity and Geography,\" \"The Role of Diversity in Public Institutions,\" and \"Reducing Racial Employment Gaps for Young Adults Without College Education.\"\u00a0 Again, this is not a syllabus from the sociology department at Brandeis. This is the Fed. These are the people in charge of our monetary policy who are supposed to be keeping America from collapsing. But they're ignoring their actual job in favor of pretending that they're professors at Brandeis. \u00a0 CHINA ACCUSES WHITE HOUSE OF LYING ABOUT BIDEN BRINGING UP GENOCIDE, FORCED LABOR WITH XI \u00a0   Video It's lunatic and they're still talking this way. In April, well after it was very clear inflation was not transitory, Janet Yellen, the treasury secretary, former head of the Fed, someone who should be charged for what she did to the U.S. economy, gave a speech not about the U.S. economy. She's the Treasury Secretary. No, but about climate change and why climate change is more important than saving the United States. \u00a0 We're quoting, \"We must redouble our efforts to decarbonize our economies,\" Yellen said at an address at the Atlantic Council. Keep in mind, Janet Yellen doesn't know anything about climate. She can't drive a standard transmission. She knows nothing about the material world, but there she is, spouting off on climate change and decarbonizing, reading every stupid, faddish talking point the Atlantic Council audience wanted to hear about and she's still doing it. We're in a slow-down, she said on Sunday, and it's not affecting too many sectors of the economy, says Janet Yellen. Watch.\u00a0 JANET YELLEN:   This is not an economy that's in recession, but we're in a period of transition in which growth is slowing, and that's necessary and appropriate, and we need to be growing at a steady and sustainable pace. So, there is a slowdown and businesses can see that, and that's appropriate given that people now have jobs and we have a strong labor market, but you don't see any of the signs now. A recession is a broad-based contraction that affects many sectors of the economy. We just don't have that.\u00a0 TREASURY SEC.

Let's be clear. Janet Yellen is a completely incompetent affirmative-action hire who did profound generational damage to the United States during her time running the Fed. Now, she's doing the same while running the Treasury Department and yet no one ever calls her on it. The things she says don't make sense. She can't even predict inflation when every single other person in the country knew it was coming based on the federal government's spending patterns.\u00a0 Keep spending money. That's what she's still saying. Everyone in the Biden administration is saying that. In May, the head of USAID, Samantha Power\u2014she's back\u2014 declared that worldwide fertilizer shortage is actually a good thing. Starvation is a good thing because that means fewer carbon emissions. Never let a crisis go to waste, she said. She actually said that. \u00a0 NEW YORK TIMES COLUMN CLAIMS WE ARE NOT IN A RECESSION, NEWS ON INFLATION IS \u2018ENCOURAGING\u2019 \u00a0 Inside the White House, no one's even pretending to care as the U.S. economy falls apart.

We're not going to acknowledge it's even happening, and so they're not and no one's forcing them to. That's what they're saying. This is untenable. Unless you're an utterly partisan economist, you have to acknowledge what's happening. But those highly credentialed are not acknowledging it. They're blaming Putin. They're blaming January 6 and of course, on the basic point of whether the economy is in trouble, there are very few people left to deny it. \u00a0 GAYLE KING, CBS JULY 19:  The threat of an economic downturn is shaking up consumers and small business owners.

You can't deny it. We've reached the limit of denial. \u00a0 Take a look at this chart. Notice that right before the 2008 recession, the consumer price index was surging just as it is now. Prices went up until the crash, so they always crash. Why does that happen? What happens? For a simple reason. Goods become too expensive for people to buy and then GDP collapses.

Both Democratic Lieutenant Governor John Fetterman, and celebrity physician-turned-GOP-candidate Dr. Mehmet Oz talked to Fox News Digital about issues facing America, including President Biden's administration, the economy, energy and more. Here's what the two dueling candidates had to say. On a scale of 1 to 10, how would you rate Joe Biden\u2019s handling of the presidency and why? Fetterman:  \"There is still more work to be done, the American people are struggling, and we need to make sure the government is doing all we can to lower prices and help working people.\" DR. OZ: THE ONLY THING JOE BIDEN IS BUILDING BACK BETTER IS THE REPUBLICAN PARTY Oz: \" Joe Biden has completely failed our country and has earned a 0 for not showing up. His wasteful spending, attack on American energy, failure to deal with inflation, and open border policies have been disastrous for our nation. \"My opponent, John Fetterman gave him a great rating during a debate earlier this year even though the majority of Americans agree that our country is not headed in the right direction under  Joe Biden\u2019s Administration .

Fetterman:  \"We still have a lot of work to do to get  rising costs and inflation  in order and bring down prices for working people across this country. People are hurting. I would continue to fight inflation by expanding manufacturing here at home and simplifying our supply chains. Making more shit in America will drive down prices for everyone and create more good-paying jobs for people across Pennsylvania. I would also take on corporate greed and the CEOs who are making record profits all while charging the people of Pennsylvania more and more.

When I fill up my Dodge RAM, it's still costing a hell of a lot more than it did a year ago. When I go shopping for groceries, almost everything I buy costs more. \"If we're going to be serious about bringing down gas prices, we need to suspend the federal gas tax to provide immediate relief for people at the pump.

So it's not just energy we should be making here at home. It's everything. We should be ramping up production across industries, increasing capacity and supply to bring down prices across the board.

We have enough natural gas underneath our feet to power the whole country for more than 200 years. Yet, Joe Biden and John Fetterman have launched an attack on American energy - forcing us to become reliant on our adversaries around the globe. John Fetterman called for canceling the Keystone Pipeline and called fracking a \u2018stain on Pennsylvania.\u2019 \"We need to unleash the power of American energy, not go overseas begging for energy from Iran, Russia, and Venezuela.

Their policies have sent the economy spiraling into a recession and have robbed Americans of their savings. I care about fixing problems. I spent my life in the medical field, inventing life-saving devices and empowering my patients to become experts on their own health.

He is not one of us, and he sure as hell won't fight for us in Washington.\u00a0 He just moved here from New Jersey to run for Senate. Just like he\u2019s been doing on television for nearly two decades now, Dr. Oz is just saying and doing whatever will benefit him personally.\" Oz:  \"I\u2019m a political outsider - not a career politician like John Fetterman. I\u2019m ready to take on the establishment and the disastrous Biden-Fetterman agenda of rising crime, skyrocketing inflation, weak leadership, and failing schools.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!\n   The Democrats responsible for keeping public schools closed during the COVID-19 pandemic have faced zero repercussions more than two years after the lockdowns that left millions of children behind and in crisis. School closures in the U.S. have had a devastating impact on children\u2019s mental health, development and future earnings potential. According to data released last month by the National Center for Education Statistics, 70% of  U.S. public schools have reported  an increase in students seeking mental health services since the start of the pandemic. A study published by the conservative think tank Just Facts reported that the mental stressors brought about by school closures will  destroy seven times  more years of life than lockdowns saved.\u00a0 A study by the American Enterprise Institute also found that  nearly 1.3 million students  have left public schools since the pandemic began, and schools that stayed remote longer saw even more students leave. The World Bank reported last month that the school closures will cost this generation of students $21 trillion in earnings over their lifetimes, which is far more than the $17 trillion estimated in 2021. A working paper first released in October 2020, which examined over 10,000 school districts across the country and their reopening plans, found that partisan politics and teachers union strength in a particular area had far more influence on schools reopening than science or local health guidance.\u00a0 \"Altogether, we find little evidence that the reopening plans adopted by the nation\u2019s 13,000+ school boards were linked to the public health conditions on the ground in their local community,\"  the study found .\u00a0     \n      A woman puts a sign on her car prior to the Occupy City Hall Protest and Car Caravan hosted by Chicago Teachers Union on Aug, 3, 2020.\n       (Kail Krzacynski/AFP via Getty Images) Evidence shows the main drivers behind the school closures were teachers unions, which donate almost exclusively to Democrats. The American Federation of Teachers has donated 100% \u2013 a total of $2,674,719 \u2013 to Democratic candidates in the 2022 election cycle, and the National Education Association (NEA) has donated 98.4% \u2013 a total of $1,941,045 \u2013 to Democratic candidates this cycle,  according to OpenSecrets.org . BIDEN ADMIN KEEPS GIVING TEACHERS UNIONS POLITICAL VICTORIES \"School closures were always more about politics and power than safety and the needs of children,\" Corey A. DeAngelis, a school choice advocate and the national director of research of the American Federation for Children, said in a statement provided to Fox News Digital. \"Meanwhile private schools, daycares, grocery stores, and other businesses were able to figure it out from the get-go.\" \"These union-induced school closures hurt children academically, mentally, and physically,\" he continued. \"Teachers unions fought against reopening schools every step of the way. They even lobbied the CDC to keep schools closed longer. Government officials weren't following the science, they were following the Political Science.\" Despite the numerous studies saying school closures had catastrophic effects on one of the nation\u2019s most vulnerable populations, the Democrats responsible for the lockdowns have not been recalled or fired in the more than two years since the pandemic struck. Randi Weingarten Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers (AFT), one of the nation\u2019s most powerful teachers unions, was reelected to serve an eighth term this month at the union\u2019s convention in Boston. Weingarten slammed Republicans during her keynote speech, describing them as \"the anti-public schools crowd, the anti-union crowd, the privatizers, the haters,\" who want to dismantle public education,  Education Week reported . \"When people with power try to lock in systems that privilege the few, decimate the middle class and make every day a struggle for working people, we fight for a better life for all and for the next generation to do even better,\"\u00a0 Weingarten said during the convention , which also featured\u00a0first lady Jill Biden, a National Education Association (NEA) union member, as a speaker.\u00a0     \n      Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, speaks alongside Michael Mulgrew, president of the United Federation of Teachers, a New York City union, during a news conference, Oct. 4, 2021, in Manhattan. (Associated Press)\n       Teachers unions have been targeted by critics for having had a hand in keeping schools closed. Infamously, the AFT and the NEA were discovered to have corresponded with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention last year to make last-minute  changes to school reopening guidance , which included a phased reopening approach for K-12 schools based on coronavirus cases in the area. Communications obtained by the\u00a0New York Post\u00a0through a Freedom of Information Act request\u00a0by conservative group\u00a0Americans for Public Trust\u00a0 showed numerous emails  between top CDC officials and the AFT just days before the Biden administration released the school reopening guidelines in February 2021.\u00a0The lobbying efforts were a reported success, as the Post found at least two instances when\u00a0\"suggestions\"\u00a0were used nearly word-for-word within the CDC\u2019s guidelines. The CDC had been prepared to allow in-school instruction regardless of transmission rates, but at the suggestion of the union, the guidelines were adjusted to include a provision that said, \"In the event of high community-transmission results from a new variant of SARS-CoV-2, a new update of these guidelines may be necessary.\" REPUBLICANS EXPOSE \u2018UNCOMMON\u2019 CDC, TEACHERS' UNION TIES ON COVID SCHOOL REOPENING GUIDANCE IN REPORT The union further requested that teachers be granted remote work access for those \"who have documented high-risk conditions or who are at increased risk.\" Similar provisions were included for \"staff who have a household member\" that is considered high risk to the virus. Emails reviewed by Fox News Digital  showed that the AFT and the NEA also received a copy of the guidance before the CDC released it to the public.\u00a0 Responding to the backlash over the correspondence, Weingarten suggested it was routine procedure. \"This is normal rulemaking, frankly,\" she told C-SPAN in May 2021. \"This is what every administration used to do. The problem with the last administration is that they didn't do it.\" Education will be a major issue going into the November midterm elections, evidenced by the devastating Democratic Party election defeat of union-backed Virginia gubernatorial candidate Terry McAuliffe to now-Gov. Glenn Youngkin, who made education and parental rights the central tenet of his campaign.\u00a0 Weingarten, who campaigned for McAuliffe, has since been trying to rebrand herself as a champion for keeping schools open, but her past comments show that was not the case. \"There\u2019s no way that you\u2019re going to have full-time schools for all the kids and all the teachers the way we used to have it,\"  Weingarten said\u00a0 in July 2020. At the time, Weingarten slammed the Trump administration\u2019s guidelines to reopen schools by fall 2020 as \"reckless,\" \"callous\" and \"cruel.\" She later called on Congress for more federal funding for schools and threatened a strike if they reopened without implementing expansive safety precautions like mask mandates, 6-foot social distancing requirements (up from the CDC\u2019s recommended 3-foot distance at the time), and updated ventilation systems.\u00a0 While many school districts across the country, like in Florida, reopened for the fall of 2020, Weingarten was advocating for improving remote learning.\u00a0 \"We have an obligation to make remote better because until we can really decrease community spread throughout the United States, distance learning and distance working is going to be a fact of life,\"  she said  in August 2020. In July 2021, Weingarten said \"millions\" would die from Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis\u2019 handling of the pandemic, but she later  walked back her claim . Weingarten signaled the potential for future school lockdowns as recently as January of this year, tweeting, \"There are very real logistical decisions schools are making. We know kids do better in person, but the spike is real. We need adequate staff & the safety measures in place including testing, masking ventilation. There is a lot of stress.\" Weingarten\u2019s tweet came on the heels of her announcement on CNN that she \"personally\" supported mandating the vaccine for school children five and older. The AFT did not respond to Fox News Digital\u2019s request for comment. Rochelle Walensky Dr.\u00a0Rochelle Walensky, who was appointed by President Biden as the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in January 2021, repeatedly bowed to pressure from teachers unions on COVID-19-related guidance for schools. She  met with parents just one time  leading up to the CDC\u2019s release of school reopening guidance on Feb. 12, 2021, her internal calendar revealed, while teachers unions had constant access to her and other high-level CDC officials while influencing last-minute changes to the guidelines.     \n      CDC Director Rochelle Walensky testifies before the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee on Capitol Hill,, Nov. 4, 2021.\u00a0\n       (Chip Somodevilla/Getty) Walensky's internal calendar indicates she had only conducted one\u00a0 meeting with parents \u00a0on February 10, 2021 \u2013 just two days before the release of the school reopening guidance. The 30-minute Zoom session allowed each unidentified parent just three minutes to \"introduce themselves and discuss their needs for safe school reopening,\" her calendar showed. Months later, Weingarten used a screen capture of the event to hit Fox News and other outlets that began reporting on the CDC's coziness with teachers unions. \"Fox, WSJ, NY Post, and The 74 are probably never going to let their readers know that the CDC met with parents too,\" Weingarten wrote. \"But everyone should know that they did, and that the NYPost knew they did when they wrote their hit piece. This is how the CDC gets stakeholder feedback.\" Teachers unions also influenced the CDC\u2019s masking guidance in May 2021 after the NEA threatened White House officials with publicly releasing harsh criticism, emails reviewed by Fox News Digital showed. The CDC initially announced on May 13, 2021, that fully vaccinated Americans could stop wearing masks indoors and outside, which sparked confusion about how the policy would apply to schools. One day later, on May 14, 2021, Erika Dinkel-Smith, the White House director of labor engagement, said she stopped the NEA from releasing a critical statement that had called for \"CDC clarification right away.\" Later that day, Walensky apparently held a meeting with Weingarten and NEA President\u00a0Becky Pringle on the issue, according to the emails.\u00a0Following discussion and coordination with the Biden White House, the NEA  released a\u00a0statement \u00a0with a much less critical tone. On May 15, 2021, two days after the CDC\u2019s initial announcement, the CDC\u00a0updated\u00a0its masking guidance to indicate that all people should wear a mask at school regardless of vaccination status.\u00a0 A few months later, Walensky slammed schools for reopening without implementing mask and vaccine mandates for school staff and students. \"I want to strongly appeal to those districts who have not implemented prevention strategies and encourage them to do the right thing to protect the children under their care,\" she said during a Aug. 27, 2021, White House press briefing. In March of this year, Republican lawmakers who sit on the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis released a report revealing a CDC official\u2019s testimony claiming the agency\u2019s coordination with teachers unions in drafting the guidances was \"uncommon.\" The report accused Walensky of allowing the AFT to insert language in the reopening guidance \"that made it more likely schools across the country would remain closed after February 2021.\" Some Republicans called for Walensky to resign over the coordination with teachers unions. Walensky defended herself while testifying before the subcommittee on March 30, saying, \"As a reflection of what\u00a0happened after that guidance \u2026 46 percent of schools were open before that guidance, 60 percent just a few months after. Those guidances opened schools.\" The CDC did not respond to Fox News Digital\u2019s request for comment. Becky Pringle Becky Pringle, who was elected president of the NEA in September 2020, vowed to fight the Trump administration and then-Education Secretary Betsy DeVos\u2019 push to get kids back in the classroom. During an  October 2020 interview  with Politico, Pringle said the union would demand stringent COVID-19-related safety precautions through strikes, protests and sickouts, and by backing lawsuits blocking efforts to reopen in red states like Florida, Iowa and Georgia. Pringle also slammed Republicans at the time for arguing teachers should be treated as essential workers, arguing that the focus should be on improving the quality of remote learning. \"I don\u2019t think being in front of a classroom of 30 students is like anything else,\"\u00a0 she told Chalkbeat  in August 2020. \"You can\u2019t make that comparison, and just say: \u2018They are essential workers, so go back to work.\u2019 You are responsible for students, their safety and their welfare, their learning, and their lives.\" Along with the AFT, Pringle\u2019s NEA corresponded with the CDC last year to make  last-minute changes  to its February 2021 school reopening guidance, and both unions received a copy of the guidance before the CDC released it to the public, emails showed.\u00a0     \n      Vice President Kamala Harris waves with Becky Pringle, president of the National Education Association, at the NEA's annual meeting and representative assembly in Chicago, July 5, 2022.\n       (Tannen Maury/EPA/Bloomberg via Getty Images) In January 2021, just weeks before the CDC released its reopening guidance,\u00a0a White House staffer facilitated a meeting between Walensky and Pringle, emails showed. \"I'm reaching out to introduce you to Carole Johnson from our Covid team,\" Maureen Tracey-Mooney, special assistant to the president for education, wrote in a Jan. 31, 2021, email to Carrie Pugh, who at the time was the senior director of campaigns and elections at the NEA.\u00a0 \"She'd like to set up a meeting with Pres. Pringle for tomorrow with her and CDC Director Walensky,\" Tracey-Mooney wrote. Less than an hour later, Johnson responded to an email from Pugh, writing,\u00a0\"We would welcome the opportunity to hear directly from President Pringle and to continue to have the benefit of NEA's insights as we work on reopening schools safely.\" The NEA also successfully pressured to CDC clarify its masking guidance on May 15, 2021, to indicate that all people should wear a mask at school regardless of vaccination status. Pringle often argued for stricter reopening requirements than the CDC recommended. On Feb. 9, 2021, she argued that teachers should be among the first to receive the COVID-19 vaccine, even though the CDC\u2019s Walensky said earlier that week that vaccinations were not a necessary requirement for reopening safely as long as other mitigation practices were in place. In October 2021,\u00a0Pringle voiced support for mandating the COVID-19 vaccine for students in order to resume in-person learning. \"Just like other vaccinations, we believe that and have always believed that school environments are safest when everyone is vaccinated against these infectious diseases. COVID is no different,\"  she told CBS News . \"We need to make sure that is added to the list of vaccinations that are required for students to go to school.\" On Jan. 13, after the  Supreme Court struck down  Biden\u2019s vaccine mandate on businesses with over 100 employees, Pringle tweeted, \"The Supreme Court's shocking ruling that OSHA lacks statutory authority to protect workers from the workplace hazards of COVID-19 is a devastating blow to this administration's efforts to protect millions. This decision will stymie efforts to keep school buildings open and safe.\" During its convention earlier this month in Chicago, the  NEA reportedly debated  a resolution calling for mandatory masking, COVID vaccines in schools, and permanent remote learning options, though it is unclear if it was adopted. During her keynote speech on July 3, Pringle praised union members for weathering \"countless attacks\" over the course of the pandemic, and she said the 2022 midterm elections would be a referendum against those who fight against public education. \"We have become exhausted by the demands created by crippling educator shortages. We have felt our voices grow hoarse from demanding professional pay and the respect we deserve,\"  she said . \"Just as we did in the presidential election of 2020, we will make sure you know who we are. If you stand against our students, we will stand against you. If you vote against our educators, we will vote against you.\" Pringle won\u2019t be up for reelection at the NEA until 2023. Unlike the AFT, which doesn\u2019t have term limits, the NEA only allows executive members to serve two, three-year terms.\u00a0 The NEA did not respond to Fox News Digital\u2019s request for comment. Gavin Newsom California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat\u00a0whose candidacy and recall fight was largely funded by teachers\u2019 unions, outraged parents in October 2020 when he\u00a0sent his four kids back to in-person learning at a private school in Sacramento County, while public schools in the county and much of the state remained closed due to the pandemic.     \n      California Gov.

He was later sued over the private school closures, and in a win for school choice advocates more than a year later,\u00a0the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals\u00a0 ruled in July 2021  that the governor violated the fundamental \"right\u00a0of parents to control their children\u2019s education and to choose their children\u2019s educational forum.\" A June  analysis by Burbio , which routinely audits 5,000 school districts across all 50 states, found that California remains last only to the District of Columbia for returning to in-person learning. Over the course of the pandemic, Newsom declined to use his emergency powers to compel schools to reopen amid intense pressure from teachers unions. Even when restaurants and bars were permitted to reopen, many school districts in the state remained closed, especially those with powerful teachers unions like those in San Francisco and Los Angeles. Republicans and parents groups angered over the lockdowns launched a recall effort against Newsom, which failed in September 2021.

During a recent House hearing, Buttigieg told Rep.

How is this bill supposed to fight inflation? First, by allowing the government to negotiate certain drug prices, which supposedly will save $288 billion over 10 years.

Fully 40% of that ($122 billion) comes from revoking a rule put in place by the  Trump administration  that was never going to be implemented anyway. Such are the games played in this legislation.\u00a0 There is no doubt that the government  could  effectively set prices on a variety of drugs, since it controls roughly 36% of total healthcare spending.

Of course, since Democrats deny that their reckless $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan blew up our already bloated budget deficit and delivered inflation, this is a tricky argument.\u00a0 Apparently, some deficits are worse than others.   Video In any event, the deficit impact depends partly on whether giving the IRS an additional $80 billion will yield substantial incremental revenues.\u00a0 MANCHIN WON'T COMMIT TO SUPPORTING BIDEN IN 2024: \u2018JUST HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE\u2019 In an earlier iteration of Build Back Better, the  Biden administration  estimated such an investment in tax snoops would yield $316 billion over 10 years; the nonpartisan CBO cut that down to $200 billion. Now Democrats estimate the windfall at $124 billion, a further downgrade that does little to build our confidence. The other source of increased revenue comes from tax hikes that, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation, would raise an additional $16.7 billion on American taxpayers earning less than $200,000 in 2023.\u00a0The proposal would raise another\u00a0$14.1 billion\u00a0from taxpayers earning between\u00a0$200,000 and $500,000. Moreover, over the 10-year window covered by the bill, the  average tax rate  paid by every single income category would increase.   Video That\u2019s because the 15% minimum tax on \"book\" corporate profits \u2013 profits reduced by the immediate expensing of depreciation for tax purposes \u2013 will stifle business spending that increases productivity and that leads to wage increases.

Yet if a manager is a perfectionist, this can raise the bar of expectations higher, which can cause  extra stress and anxiety  and put a person's job performance, future job reviews \u2014 and, yes, even pay on the line.

If you\u2019re not a perfectionist but the boss is, here are tips on how to understand more about the dynamics that are at work. Understand a leader's perfectionism If your boss expects perfection from you on daily tasks, reports, proposals and dynamic projects \u2014 yet you don\u2019t meet expectations \u2014 it's very likely this will cause added tension in a probably already high-stress workplace.     \n      A worker meets with a manager. \"Perfectionist bosses come in degrees,\" said a senior performance consultant.\u00a0\n       (iStock) Understanding the scope of a manager\u2019s expectations can help. \"Perfectionist bosses come in degrees,\" explained Jill Chapman, senior performance consultant at national HR service provider Insperity in Houston, Texas.\u00a0 TIME MANAGEMENT: HOW TO BE MORE PRODUCTIVE AT WORK At the more reasonable end of the spectrum, Chapman said, perfectionists know their weaknesses \u2014 and they welcome feedback so that they can get closer to being a truly great leader. There are several strategies employees can use to work effectively under the most perfectionist of bosses.

Know what sets a manager off To begin with, if things or actions are particularly irksome to a boss, Chapman advises that people figure out how to avoid doing those things.\u00a0 \"For example, if typos really get under your the manager's skin, carefully proofread everything before sending it,\" she suggested.\u00a0     \n      Office workers interacting on a project.

Tread carefully with contradiction If you disagree with your boss on an issue, you must be prepared to present an opinion that brings something of value to the discussion, said Chapman. \"Always maintain a professional manner and never speak or act on emotions.\"   That way, you are exhibiting the expertise for which you were hired \u2014 and underlining how you can contribute to the best outcome, she noted.\u00a0 \"Always maintain a professional manner and never speak or act on emotions,\" continued Chapman.\u00a0     \n      Aligning your work ethic with a manager's high standards may be a step in the right direction.\u00a0\n       (iStock) \"This is especially important to neutralize the effects of working with an extreme perfectionist who thrives on drama.\" Be motivated to improve your performance Aligning your work ethic with a manager's high standards may be a step in the right direction.\u00a0 \"See if it\u2019s possible to learn from the perfectionism,\" said Dave Fisch, CEO at Ladders, a job site that connects professionals to hiring teams and recruiters for jobs with annual salaries of $100,000 or more.\u00a0 CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"Ask yourself if you ever feel more satisfaction from a finished piece of work or project because you were pushed.\"\u00a0 Your acquired positive work habits could set the lasting foundation for added career success.\u00a0 \u00a0     Erica Lamberg is a contributing reporter for Fox News Digital."},

NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!\n   The implications of the Manchin-Schumer Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 on the upcoming  midterm elections  could potentially hinder election chances for the Democratic Party as they seek to maintain their slim majority in the House and Senate, according to multiple tax experts and strategists. In statements provided to Fox News Digital, several strategists highlighted the impact new taxes have on Americans, insisting Democrats must be honest with voters about the measure going into the midterm elections. Specifically, the experts said Democrats should clarify the cost of the proposed legislation and how tax increase, no matter the size, has the potential to  impact American taxpayers . While some strategists noted benefits that would stem from the passage of the measure, others insisted that new taxes amid an economic recession could move some Democratic voters to favor Republican candidates in the midterm elections. In contrast, others insisted that Democrats should campaign using the legislation in the days leading up to the midterm elections. The nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) revealed in an analysis last week that the Manchin bill, which would spend $433 billion on climate change initiatives, would increase taxes by billions of dollars, including on middle-class earners.

Overall, starting in 2023, taxes would increase by $16.7 billion for Americans earning less than $200,000. For taxpayers earning between $200,000 and $500,000, the bill would increase taxes cumulatively by $14.1 billion. Brooke Rollins, president and CEO of the conservative America First Policy Institute, said the \"stakes for hardworking Americans and their families could not be higher\" than with the Inflation Reduction Act. \"At the core of the laundry list of issues our nation now faces is a crisis of leadership coupled with a failure to implement policy that puts the American people first,\" said Rollins, the former White House director of the Domestic Policy Council and chief strategist in the Trump administration. \"In a last-ditch effort to put a 'win' on the scoreboard before the midterms and after multiple failed attempts, the Biden Administration is yet again trying to revive the behemoth of a spending bill \u2014 this time deceitfully disguised as an effort to reduce inflation,\" she added. Rollins also insisted the  measure backed by Sen. Joe Manchin , D-W.Va., \"shatters\" Biden's promise to Americans that only those making more than $400,000 will see an increase in taxes as it \"raises taxes on people earning as little as $30,000 a year.\" Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, insisted the measure has a \"host of things to like,\" including \"deficit reduction in a time of near record debt, policies to push against inflation rather than exacerbate it, and closing tax loopholes and increasing tax compliance.\" \"The JCT score shows the Inflation Reduction Act has a negligible effect on middle-class taxes when it\u2019s fully phased in \u2013 and in fact, the bill as a whole is a very small net tax cut,\" MacGuineas said. \"Once you account for the bill\u2019s consumer tax rebates, insurance subsidies, and drug price reductions \u2013 not to mention the bill\u2019s deflationary effects \u2013 the Inflation Reduction Act will almost certainly increase disposable income for families making less than $400,000.\" MANCHIN-SCHUMER SPENDING BILL TARGETS TAX LOOPHOLE FAVORED BY INVESTORS     \n      U.S. Capitol dome is lit by the morning sun, March 14, 2022.\n       (Bill Clark/CQ-Roll Call, Inc) The bill was introduced just days after the gross domestic product (GDP) contracted for a second consecutive quarter from April-June, signaling the economy had  entered into a recession .

However, exaggerating the increase without mentioning the benefits is also off-base.\" \"According to the 6 pages of federal taxes changes per income category in the JCT report, there is a rise, though a fractional one of between 0.1%, and 0.2% in taxes for taxpayers making between $30,000 and $100,000 per year for 2023,\" Prins stated. \"That increase is .3% for taxpayers making between $100,000 and $500,000 a year, and .5% for taxpayers making more than $500,000 per year.\" \"The White House considers the JCT analysis a measure of the cost side of taxes that ignores other direct benefits from the bill,\" Prins added. \"That\u2019s like saying that the payroll tax withdrawal for social security is not a tax because it\u2019s a benefit.

Brian Kemp on Wednesday signed an executive order extending the suspension for a third time. The order also suspends the state sales tax on train locomotive fuel. Kemp previously signed a law in March that passed with broad bipartisan support suspending the state\u2019s gas tax through May 31. Kemp signed earlier extensions in May and July. GEORGIA'S LOTTERY NUMBERS FOR TUESDAY, AUG. 2 Under state law, Kemp can suspend taxes by executive order as long as state lawmakers ratify the action the next time they meet. Kemp abated gas taxes in 2021 during a pipeline shutdown, and former Gov. Nathan Deal suspended gas taxes multiple times. Georgia\u2019s gasoline price  normally includes a federal tax of 18.4 cents per gallon and a state tax of 29.1 cents per gallon. A number of counties and the city of Atlanta also charge taxes. Federal taxes on diesel fuel are 24.4 cents per gallon, while Georgia\u2019s tax on diesel is 32.6 cents per gallon. Kemp's extension comes as gas prices are falling sharply from summer highs. According to motorist group AAA, the average price for a gallon of regular gas in Georgia was $3.72. That's down 60 cents in a month. While the national average is now $4.16, Georgia is one of 19 states, mostly in the South and Midwest, with average gas prices below $4 a gallon. GEORGIA RESIDENTS CAN CLAIM UNBORN CHILDREN AS DEPENDENTS ON STATE TAXES Gas prices in Georgia remain 75 cents a gallon above where they were a year ago.     \n      Georgia's governor has suspended the tax on gas through Sept. 12.\n       A gallon of diesel fuel is averaging $4.97 a gallon, down 47 cents in the last month. Kemp blamed President Joe Biden for inflation and high gas prices as he runs for reelection and seeks to tie his Democratic opponent, Stacey Abrams, to the unpopular president. \"We can\u2019t fix everything Washington has broken, but we\u2019re doing our part to combat the economic headwinds caused by the President\u2019s failed policies,\" Kemp said in a statement. Abrams on Wednesday repeated her call for Kemp to suspend the gas tax through the end of the year.  Democrats believe Kemp  is milking the repeated suspensions for news coverage. \"Today, Brian Kemp once again refused to provide Georgians with the stability they deserve, and instead is prioritizing politics over committing to a full suspension of the gas tax through the end of the year as I have,\" Abrams said in a statement. GEORGIA DEPUTIES ARRESTED AFTER ALLEGEDLY SMUGGLING CONTRABAND INTO JAILS The price of oil has risen dramatically around the world since  Russian President Vladimir Putin  began amassing troops on Ukraine's border and then invaded the eastern European country.

NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!\n   Democratic and Republican campaign committees remain at odds with how abortion will impact the upcoming midterm elections, just one day after a majority of Kansas voters  rejected a constitutional amendment  that would have given lawmakers in the state the ability to regulate abortion. Kansas became the first state in the nation Tuesday to vote on an abortion-related issue since the  Supreme Court's ruling  to overturn federal protections for abortion granted under the 1973 landmark case Roe v. Wade. The outcome of that vote, which resulted in a failure to pass the Value Them Both amendment, now poses a question of whether the debate around abortion will turn voters out to the polls in November. While Democrats suggest the protection of legal abortion is a driving force for voters, Republicans still say Americans are still focused on the economy as the elections rapidly approach. \"Last night, voters in a red state delivered a clear message to Republicans: come for our right to make our own health care decisions, and we will vote you down,\" Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) spokesperson Helen Kalla said in a statement following the vote in Kansas.

Turnout for the abortion vote could meet or even exceed turnout for the 2008 presidential race.\u00a0 Asked about the decision from  Kansas  voters and whether it is a signal for what may be to come in the midterm elections, Michael McAdams, communications director for the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC), insisted in a statement to Fox News Digital that Democrats created an \"economic mess\" that voters will carry with them to the polls in November.

Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., announced last week he reached an agreement with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., on the bill after more that a year of negotiations among Democrats. DEMOCRATS' SOCIAL SPENDING BILL HAS FUNDING TO FIGHT EVERYTHING FROM COW TO CAR EMISSIONS Manchin previously shut down negotiations on the package. But on Wednesday he said they came to a deal for a vastly pared-down version of the original Build Back Better bill that includes tax, climate and\u00a0 prescription drug provisions. \u00a0 Biden said the bill will \"reduce inflationary\u00a0pressure on the economy\" and will \"restore fairness to the tax code\" by making the largest corporations \"pay their fair share.\"     \n      Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., calls on a reporter during a press conference about the Democrats' reconciliation bill.\u00a0\n       (Tyler Olson/Fox News) The reconciliation package raises revenue by requiring corporations with more than $1 billion in profits to pay at least a 15% tax rate and by enforcing the law so that corporations and high-income individuals pay the taxes they owe. The bill also closes the \"carried interest\" loophole for investment fund managers with at least $400,000 in income, which a White House official said enables them to pay a significantly lower tax rate than middle-class families. SCHUMER AND MANCHIN'S $700B SPENDING BILL UNDERCUTS EFFORTS TO WOO BLUE-COLLAR VOTERS The White House estimates the 15% corporate tax rate will raise $313 billion over the next decade. A nonpartisan congressional panel, the\u00a0 Joint Committee on Taxation , estimates that nearly 50% of the total will come from American manufacturers.\u00a0 Biden has stressed, though, that the bill would not impose any new taxes on people making less than $400,000 per year.     \n      President Biden said the bill gives Medicare the power to negotiate for lower prescription drug prices, locks in place lower health care premiums for families for the next three years and addresses the climate crisis.\n       (Fox News photo illustration) Biden said the bill gives Medicare the power to negotiate for lower prescription drug prices, locks in place lower health care premiums for families for the next three years and addresses the climate crisis. \"It\u2019s a very simple message: Democrats are getting ready to vote for tax hikes during a recession,\" a GOP aide told Fox News. \"The sharks are already circling underneath the plank they will walk off.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The\u00a0 U.S. economy shrank \u00a0in the spring for the second consecutive quarter, meeting the criteria for a recession as record-high inflation and higher interest rates forced consumers and businesses to pull back on spending.

She called out Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and  former Education Secretary Betsy DeVos , claiming that kids won\u2019t become critical thinkers and learn lessons of life if they \"get their way.\" She claimed further that \"schools are a way of creating pluralism and diversity\" and \"that's why there's censorship of books and lessons, and calling educators \"woke.\" Last month, DeSantis and DeVos delivered speeches as keynote speakers at a summit held by a conservative parental-rights organization called Moms For Liberty.\u00a0 The summit was a 3-day event to equip members from 30 states on how to elect more conservative candidates to school boards. OKLAHOMA PUBLIC SCHOOLS REQUIRING STUDENTS COMPLETE \u2018BIOLOGICAL SEX AFFIDAVITS\u2019 TO PARTICIPATE IN SPORTS At the summit, DeVos, a staunch school choice advocate, called for the Department of  Education to be \"abolished\"  in order to leave education decisions to state and local boards. \"These extremists are fighting these culture wars, and the attacks are only going to get worse. It's a strategy to divide educators from parents, to create apathy and fear. These are the biggest tools they have to win,\" Weingarten said, according to AFT. \"Right-wing extremists have said that the way to universal vouchers is to create universal distrust. But our members stuck with the union after Janus. And people around the country understand the importance of unions. That's why they're fighting these culture wars.\"     \n      American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten praised the deal as a \"game-changer for teachers and families drowning in an ocean of online dishonesty.\"\n       (REUTERS/Aaron P.

They want their kids to learn & to be safe. That's why we started our #ReadingOpensTheWorld program - to increase literacy and get kids excited about learning by giving out 1M books - and focus on community schools,\" Weingarten said. Lindsey Burke, director of the Center for Education Policy at the Heritage Foundation, pushed back on Weingarten\u2019s comments, telling Fox News Digital that there is \"widespread support for education choice among parents, and recent polling shows Americans now trust Republicans more than Democrats when it comes to education.\" \"The unions lost parents' trust when they forced schools to close down during COVID, long after it was clear it was safe for children to return to schools. And then they demanded tens of billions of dollars from taxpayers in order to reopen them. Families want schools that align with their values, and that's why they have been pushing back against radical content in schools. Governor DeSantis has rightly recognized this, and has implemented policies to make schools more transparent and accountable to parents.\" CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP   Video Furthermore, Weingarten sounded off on tackling issues such as canceling student debt and a mental health and food insecurity crisis in the U.S. \"Thinking about ways to meet the needs of our kids, rather than endless conversations about who is \u2018woke,\u2019 is what we're doing. That's what parents want. What we need is for educators to be respected and to have the conditions we need to teach,\" Weingarten said. A survey commissioned by  Weingarten herself  found that Republicans have an advantage over Democrats in regard to voters' confidence in handling education. The American Federation of Teachers (AFT)  commissioned a poll  from Hart Research Associates, asking, \"In general, do you have more confidence in the Democrats or in the Republicans to deal with education issues?\" The survey was conducted in seven battleground states where the results showed Republicans with a 39% to 38% advantage on which party voters trust more on education. In reaction to the survey's results, AFT President Randi Weingarten pushed Democrats to ramp up messaging against  Republican attacks on critical race theory .     \n      An even mix of proponents and opponents to teaching Critical Race Theory are in attendance as the Placentia Yorba Linda School Board discusses a proposed resolution to ban it from being taught in schools.

Republicans, however, have said the climate and health care package would raise taxes across all brackets, citing a study from the Joint Committee on Taxation. \"How can Republicans attack such a bill?\" Krugman wrote. \"They can\u2019t openly defend the interests of tax evaders and avoiders, although their long-term efforts to starve the I.R.S. of resources show that in practice they are pro-tax cheater. What they have done, instead, is claim \u2014 citing an estimate from Congress\u2019s nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation \u2014 that the legislation would raise taxes on the middle class and that this violates one of Joe Biden\u2019s campaign pledges. It\u2019s a bogus claim, on multiple levels.\" Krugman said the bill \u2013 which is expected to spend $433 billion total, and raise $739 billion in tax revenue, according to Democrats \u2013 won't raise personal income taxes on anyone.

Wealthy fund managers are able to report income as capital gains, not regular income, dropping their tax rate from 37.9% to 23.8% and potentially saving them hundreds of thousands of dollars, under the little-known tax break.

Manchin's approval of the measure, which he told  \"Fox News Sunday\"  host Bret Baier \"does not raise taxes,\" has irked several Republican politics watchers in the state, as well as those who are now eyeing a potential challenge to Manchin in 2024, according to sources who have weighed developments in the state. \"The Republican bench is deep and talented in West Virginia,\" Luke Thompson, a Republican political consultant, told Fox News Digital. \"If Manchin goes through with supporting this legislation, all the bipartisan goodwill he's built up over the last two years will disappear in a flash.

NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!\n   The food crisis in America today is very real \u2014 and not limited to specific parts of the country or certain segments of society. There is also concern right now about what lies ahead in terms of the fall and winter seasons. Fox News Digital spoke to Katie Fitzgerald, president and COO of Feeding America, on Friday by phone to discuss what the organization is seeing \u2014 and she described \"a perfect storm\" of situations that are making things extremely challenging in terms of meeting the demands of  the food insecure in this country. \"The crisis that we're seeing right now is, in our judgment, in some ways worse than what we saw at the height of the pandemic,\" Fitzgerald said in the phone interview. FOOD BANKS IN AMERICA EXPERIENCE SURGING DEMAND: \u2018NO SIGN OF IT SLOWING DOWN ANY TIME SOON\u2019 Today, \"it's driven largely by inflationary pressures,\" she said. \"We don't see the root causes in terms of food insecurity [being] the same as when the economy essentially was shut down [amid  the COVID pandemic ] \u2014 that was more driven by people losing their income.\" Instead, right now, \"it's simply that people are having to make economic tradeoffs. And what they're having to cut is  their food , when everything's so much more expensive.\"     \n      A volunteer is shown packing onions in the warehouse of the Alameda County Community Food Bank in Oakland, Calif., in Nov. 2021.\n       (AP Photo/Terry Chea) \"The reason it's worse in some ways, in our point of view,\" she added, \"is that the corollary supports that helped us get us through the surge in food insecurity during the pandemic are really not available to us. And the food banks are dealing with this inflation.\" RECORD-HIGH INFLATION DRIVING MORE FAMILIES TO FOOD BANKS \u2014 \u2018THESE ARE DESPERATE SITUATIONS\u2019 Fitzgerald ticked off three specific concerns. \"Food donations are down \u2014 and that is because of the ongoing tightness in inventory and the ongoing supply chain challenges that are driven by a variety of forces.\" \"Government commodity food is way down,\" she added, \"compared to some programs that were in place during the height of the pandemic. And food banks distribute a lot of government commodity food.\" \"We're seeing more demand \u2014 and the food banks are really struggling with those inflationary pressures to meet that demand.\"   \"The third problem is that food banks have been essentially purchasing their way through this problem. And the value of their dollar is just as challenged for you and I when we go to the grocery store,\" she said. Fitzgerald said that \"70 percent of [the food banks] recently told us they're planning to purchase more food than last year \u2014 but the cost of that food is about 30-40% greater\" than before this period of very high inflation, she said.     \n      Fox News Digital spoke with Katie Fitzgerald, president and COO of Feeding America, a nonprofit organization and nationwide network of more than 200 food banks. It feeds more than 46 million people through food pantries, soup kitchens, shelters and other community agencies.\n       (Feeding America\u00a0) \"People know that the resource [of a food bank] is available to them, and they're taking advantage of it\" \u2014 that's \"the good news,\" she said. However, \"we're seeing more demand \u2014 and the food banks are really struggling with  those inflationary pressures  to meet that demand.\" She provided a deeper dive into government commodity food. \"A program called the Emergency Food Assistance program is operated by the USDA, and that program basically purchases food from the private sector and makes it available to the charitable food system in the U.S., through the USDA.\" \"They can't get as much for their money when they buy food \u2014 and assistance from the private sector is down. And commodity food is down about 30% down.\"   \"Feeding America food banks manage the vast majority of those contracts throughout the states,\" she said. \"During the height of the pandemic \u2014 when food insecurity was really high \u2014 there was a lot more of that food in the system because there were a couple of other programs in place,\" she said.     \n      Volunteers provide bananas and other food items to the needy at a food distribution event in June 2022 sponsored by the Second Harvest Food Bank of Central Florida and Orange County at St. John Vianney Church in Orlando, Florida.

So \"food banks are dealing with a 30% decline or so in available food that they can bring as a solution to their local communities.\" AS INFLATION SOARS, FOOD BANKS STRUGGLE TO MEET HIGHER DEMAND AND SKYROCKETING PRICES \"It's sort of another part of this perfect storm, where they can't get as much for their money when they buy food \u2014 and assistance from the private sector is down. And commodity food is down about 30% down.\" Here are additional points revealed about food banks right now during Fox News Digital's interview with Feeding America \u2014 and why the group is concerned about this fall and winter. Are you seeing more food insecurity in some areas of the country right now as opposed to others? \"I would say it's been pretty universal,\" said Fitzgerald. \"These forces are just sort of at play everywhere.\" \"We do have disparities across the nation in terms of food insecurity that existed before this inflation period began [and] before the pandemic,\" she said.     \n      A volunteer loads food into a car at an Armed Services YMCA food distribution event in Oct. 2021 in San Diego, California.\u00a0\n       (AP Photo/Gregory Bull) She added, \"Those same disparities still exist.\"\u00a0 She said that there are \"higher rates of food insecurity in the Deep South \u2014 in the mid-South Delta region \u2014 and that has remained the same.\" She also said, \"The one interesting and disturbing thing that we've seen is that racial disparities in food security and geographic disparities have worsened.\" NORTH CAROLINA FOOD BANK DESCRIBES \u2018DEFINITE' IMPACT OF BABY FORMULA SHORTAGE \u00a0 So, for instance, she said, \"Black individuals and Latino individuals [have experienced a] 22% and 25% increase in food insecurity during the pandemic, whereas Whites had greater levels of food security during the pandemic.\" She said the organization has been working hard \"to address these issues as a network to make sure that everyone has access to nutritious food.\" What drives the variety of food distribution methods used by food banks, and are there holdover methods from the pandemic? \"There are all different types of distribution methods out there \u2014 everything from drive-throughs to a very common model that we call the client choice, which is a lot like a retail experience,\" said Fitzgerald.\u00a0 \"It's a market experience for people to go through with a grocery cart and choose their own food.\"     \n      Some food banks use the \"client choice\" distribution model; people can go through the food center with a cart and choose the items they need.\u00a0\n       (iStock) \"There's also the farmer's market models, plus an \u2018order ahead\u2019 app, which people can use to order in advance.\" She said the drive-through models existed before the pandemic \"but were far less common,\" she said. \"They were [used] more  around the holidays , when we were distributing a big Thanksgiving dinner for folks\" and the like.\u00a0 \"The reason they became so common during the pandemic was twofold,\" she said. \"One is, it was a no-contact, low-contact method to get food to people.\" \"Nobody wants to sit in a car and wait for a long time. That's not a great experience, especially with gas costing as much as it does now.\"   Second, she said, \"was just the sheer numbers [at work]. How do you get that much food to people?\" She said that the Feeding America network of food banks have found \"that some people prefer that. As you know, people have some shame and there is a stigma around needing to get this help. So, it can be the most comfortable way for people to get help because it's just more anonymous for them.\"     \n      Cars are shown lined up to enter a food distribution event for the needy sponsored by the Second Harvest Food Bank of Central Florida and Orange County at St. John Vianney Church in Orlando, Florida.\u00a0\n       (Paul Hennessy/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) She added that food banks have continued to learn from the experiences of different food distribution methods. \"Having said that, one of the downsides with those drive-through methods \u2014 we know that nobody wants to have to sit in a car and wait for a long time. That's not a great experience for some people, especially with gas costing as much as it does now.\" Food banks have been very thoughtful about the variety of methods used, she said, as they aim to make it as comfortable and as efficient as possible. Talk to us about the drop in food donations that you've been seeing \u2014 where is this occurring?\u00a0 \"Yes, we really are,\" Fitzgerald replied in answer to the question, \"Have you seen a drop in donations?\" \"Supply chains and inventories are just so tight because consumer demand for grocery products is still so high.\"   \"The one channel that continues to be operating fairly flatly is our retail channel. We have relationships with retailers all across the country. Our food banks, our food pantries, pick up their surplus food from local Walmarts, Krogers, Stop & Shops, you name it,\" she said. So that channel, that area, is \"continuing to do pretty well,\" she said, and also noted, \"We're working really hard to optimize those channels and relationships.\"\u00a0     \n      Katie Fitzgerald of Feeding America described the retail relationship in which local grocery stores share surplus food with food banks across the country.\n       (iStock) She said, \"Manufacturing is down for us. So the donations that we get from manufacturers \u2014 with whom we have great relationships \u2014 their supply chains and their inventories are just so tight because consumer demand for grocery products is still so high.\" \"Those are the two main food donation channels\" that they have, she said. \"People are struggling to buy their own groceries, let alone buy groceries [for others] and donate them.\"   In terms of individual donations, Fitzgerald noted that \"right now we're just not seeing as much, because people are struggling to buy their own groceries, let alone buy groceries [for others] and donate them.\" \"We're seeing that pressure from the supply chain and from inflation really tamping down on our food donations,\" she said. For Americans who want to help others, what's the most effective way for them to do so? Financial donations to local food banks are the \"most effective way for people to help right now,\" said Fitzgerald.\u00a0 \"That's because purchasing food is how we're going to get the best progress on this issue, given the situation on food donations and commodities.\"     \n      Food Bank of the Southern Tier volunteers load up cars at a \"no-contact\" food distribution event during the COVID-19 pandemic.\u00a0\n       (Feeding America) Noting that not everyone can do that, Fitzgerald said, \"For those who  can  give a donation, that's very helpful. The food banks can purchase food wholesale, at much-reduced costs, that you or I can't do when we go to the grocery store.\"\u00a0 \"That's the most efficient way to help,\" she said. What if people can't donate money to food banks? How else can they help?\u00a0 \"We ask people to think about the relationships that they have [in their lives].\"\u00a0 \"If they work for food companies,\" for example, \"or if they know or have contacts in the food industry,\" Fitzgerald said they might bring up the topic to others in the corporation, \"to help people explore what can be done\" to help \u2014 and to help drive people to FeedingAmerica.org.

But without that short-term pop, the conventional wisdom remains that inflation (though Biden has brought down gas prices somewhat) will drive a sweeping Republican victory in November. And then there\u2019s the nature of the climate legislation itself, the dubiously named  Inflation Reduction Act.  Even Bernie Sanders says it will have a \"minimal impact\" on inflation. The truth is it will take a while for ordinary folks to feel the effects of the $700-billion bill, and elections are won or lost in the short term.\u00a0     \n      Sen.

That is hardly the mark of a strong incumbent.

Vice President Kamala Harris cast the tie-breaking vote to allow more than $400 billion in spending and more than $700 billion in taxes to go through under what many see as a scaled back \"build Back Better\" plan.

Although \"CNN Newsroom\" host Pamela Brown agreed economists are \"mixed\" on the impact the bill will have on inflation, she fought back against insinuations that its passage was anything other than a win on Sunday. \"You may not like what is in some of these bills, but would you concede that President Biden is one of the most legislatively successful presidents in modern history?\" Brown asked former Trump campaign advisor David Urban. \"Well, Pamela, I don't know about that, and just to take a step back, you're reading off these giant numbers, trillions of dollars.

Alex Marquardt asked her, \"So, going forward, especially into the midterms, how do [Democrats] turn this from a legislative victory into a political victory? Bash replied, \"By talking about it non-stop and messaging it in a way that we\u2019re already starting to see Democrats try to do to boil it down to how it will affect people\u2019s pocketbooks. Jessica was just talking about Medicare - allowing Medicare to negotiate prescription drug prices. That\u2019s a really big deal. Things that have to do with the climate are\u2026definitely more of a long-term investment than things like drug prices or things like expanding the tax credits when it comes to health care, but that is the key.\" Still, she recognized the uphill battle Democrats could face.\u00a0 \"Talk to any Democrat and they will admit this. The challenge is, as big of a victory as this is, and it is a huge legislative victory for the president and for Democrats, it is kind of akin to ObamaCare was back in 2009, which is, it\u2019s a victory people can\u2019t feel yet, and this is a time when people are feeling very pessimistic about their economic situation. You just look at the polls, you don\u2019t even have to, you just talk to people. You look at the price of food, you look at the price of gasoline. So, it\u2019s that juxtaposition and that challenge with how people are actually feeling in their everyday lives versus what Democrats can say is to come because of this legislation,\" Bash said.     \n      A panel on CNN suggested the Inflation Reduction Act could represent a \"vibe shift\" in the Democrats on Sunday.\n       (John Greim/LightRocket via Getty Images) On Sunday\u2019s \"Inside Politics,\" a panel suggested that this could be a \"vibe shift\" for the Democrats as they feel more optimistic about the economy and their agenda.

Instead of acknowledging the inflation crisis and the impact it\u2019s having on families nationwide, Joe Biden tried to claim that the numbers showed \"zero\" inflation. As Biden settles into a week-long beach vacation, he doesn\u2019t care about what voters think: he cares about avoiding blame for the crises he created. In other words, he is lying, and it\u2019s not the first time.\u00a0 Remember how he and his administration described inflation as \"temporary\" and \"transitory\" even as skyrocketing prices kneecapped families and made essential goods almost unattainable? Obama-Biden administration economists warned that pumping needless  trillions into the economy  would have negative consequences, but for Joe Biden all that matters is trying to change the narrative for political gain.\u00a0 Biden tried the same cheap sleight of hand with the gas crisis his policies created. Gas prices are close to $2 more per gallon than when Biden took office, and yet he had the audacity to claim Americans are \"saving\" money on gas. In fact, the average family has lost $1,500 due to higher energy prices since Biden took office. Two weeks ago, new economic data clearly illustrated that America is experiencing a recession.

The American people know that we\u2019re in a recession. 72 percent of voters think the economy is \"weak\" and 64 percent say their financial situation is \"getting worse.\" Senate Democrats\u2019 response? Passing a bill that will  make inflation worse  and raise your taxes. Go back further to when Biden oversaw a deadly and disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan. The American embassy was hurriedly evacuated, images of desperate \u00a0Afghans clinging to planes went viral, and hundreds of Americans were left behind. Thirteen brave U.S. service members died in a bombing that didn\u2019t have to happen. Now, the brutal, repressive Taliban is running Afghanistan into the ground as a result of the Biden administration\u2019s failure. Any reasonable person would look at the facts and deem such a foreign policy debacle a failure. Biden called it an \"extraordinary success.\" The Biden administration has also described mothers as \"birthing people\" and failed to label the ongoing disaster at our southern border as a crisis.

NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!\n   Rising inflation  and fuel costs in the United States have resulted in more Americans finding themselves in need of help from their local food bank and leaders in the industry tell Fox News Digital that working families are becoming fixtures in the long lines at food distribution sites. Feeding South Dakota, the only statewide food bank that serves the 900,000 people in the state\u2019s 66 counties, has seen an influx of working families facing food insecurity as inflation and  high fuel costs  make it even more difficult for food banks to keep up with demand. \"We've had an over 20% increase in families for our statewide mobile service in the past 12 months,\" Matt Burns, chief\u00a0operating officer at Feeding South Dakota, told Fox News Digital. \"You see people in between jobs who maybe normally have enough and their budget is sufficient enough in their house budget to meet all their food needs but because of inflationary pressures they're making really tough choices between food and other necessities like housing, medication, and car payments. All these things put incredible pressures on household budgets and so that is all contributing to the need and why we're seeing that 20% increase.\" \"When you're seeing 9.1% inflation here in recent months, you just cannot keep up with that,\" Burns added. \"And so that leads to families making super tough choices.\" FOOD BANKS ARE ALREADY WORRIED ABOUT FALL, WINTER \u2014 SOME FAMILIES MAY NOT HAVE TURKEYS THIS YEAR     \n      A grandmother and her granddaughter receive food at Feeding South Dakota\n       (Feeding South Dakota) While some harbor the perception that food banks only serve the homeless, other leaders in the food bank industry nationwide told Fox News Digital that they are also witnessing the same increase in the number of working families turning to food banks that Feeding South Dakota is experiencing. \"The basis for our services are the homeless, the people that are really struggling, but now it's shifted, and it's definitely working families now,\" Jorge Lupercio, Director of Operations at Placer Food Bank in  Roseville, California , told Fox News Digital. He also explained that times are even tougher for families with children who are out of school for the summer and not receiving the meals they usually receive there.\u00a0 Lupercio said the need for food at Placer Food Bank has risen significantly over the past year as inflation has skyrocketed in the  United States . FOOD BANKS IN AMERICA EXPERIENCE SURGING DEMAND: 'NO SIGN OF IT SLOWING DOWN ANY TIME SOON' During the 2019-2020 fiscal year, his\u00a0food bank distributed 324,648 pounds of food to 22,525 people at its monthly drive-thru distribution centers. In the 2021-2022 fiscal year, over 1.4 million pounds of food was distributed to 62,347 people at those sites.     \n      A drive-thru food distribution site at Placer Food Bank\n       (Placer Food Bank) Aramelle Wheeler, marketing and communications coordinator at the Food Bank of Northern Nevada outside Reno, told Fox News Digital that her organization typically serves the working poor but has seen an increase in lower-middle class and middle class families who have found themselves unable to afford food. \"We have seen even more of a shift with the middle class, especially when businesses shut down and a lot of people found themselves out of work due to COVID we saw that influx, and we\u2019ve seen a lot of those people not being able to catch up like they thought they would have by now,\"\u00a0Wheeler said.\u00a0 The issue \"continues to balloon\" as prices for everyday goods go up amid record inflation, Wheeler said, adding that FBNN is serving 117,000 Nevadans monthly on average this summer, a 17% increase from last year. AS INFLATION SOARS, FOOD BANKS STRUGGLE TO MEET HIGHER DEMAND AND SKYROCKETING PRICES The surging inflation that is driving the increased need at food banks across the country has affected Americans of all backgrounds and financial situations, which is evidenced by the long lines in  Westchester County, New York , the second-wealthiest county in the state.     \n      Food bank clients at Food Bank of Northern Nevada\n       (Food Bank of Northern Nevada) Karen Erren, president and CEO of Feeding Westchester, told Fox News Digital that her organization has expanded its food distribution times and the line is often filled with people in bright orange uniforms who have come from job sites.\u00a0 \"We serve children, we serve seniors, we serve hardworking families who just can\u2019t make ends meet,\" Erren said, adding that the demand she has seen recently is higher than it has ever been.\u00a0 \"I got a really daunting email from one of our great partners yesterday who said that in the two distributions they did they never, and I don't use that word lightly, they've never had so many people in line,\" Erren said. \"Inflation is hurting people.\" Erren explained that Feeding Westchester conducted a community needs assessment, which surveyed over 600 clients, and two-thirds of respondents said that the food pantry they visit is their primary source of food.\u00a0 FOOD BANKS \u2018NOT IMMUNE\u2019 TO INFLATIONARY PRESSURES: FEEDING AMERICA PRESIDENT     \n      Two sisters receive food at Feeding South Dakota\n       (Feeding South Dakota) \"People still to this day don\u2019t realize that there is need in our county,\" Erren said, adding that her food bank was serving 130,000-150,000 people per month before the COVID-19 pandemic and is now serving over 200,000 people each month on average. Andrew Olsen, president of Altus Marketing which works with food banks across the country, told Fox News Digital that he has heard stories from partners where people who were donors to food banks ended up in line needing food themselves. \"The traditional homeless person in need represents a very small percentage of the population that are actually getting food from the food bank network across the country,\" Olsen said. \"Most often it's single families, it's retirees, it's people who are just down on their luck. The changing demographic of need has much more become families.\"\u00a0 Lupercio said that the \"biggest thing\" that stands out to him is that \"food banking is no longer a temporary service\" but rather a permanent fixture in many households.\u00a0 \"What we're seeing now is that it's actual  working families  that, even though the parents work and sometimes even some of the family members contribute, it's still not enough,\" Lupercio said. US FOOD BANKS SEE LONG LINES, INCREASED DEMAND Food banks across the country have been forced to purchase more food as demand surges, gas prices increase, and  supply chains  continue to crunch and that cost has played a significant role in the bottom line, making it even more difficult to serve the food insecure. Lupercio says that Placer Food Bank was paying $4.03 per gallon for diesel fuel in April of last year and is now paying 65% more and the cost of purchasing basic staples such as eggs and milk has also gone up. \" The eggs alone from the same period of April of last year to August of this year, we've seen the price climb 93%,\" Lupercio said. \"The price of milk, we\u2019ve seen it climb 30%, the price of produce that we purchase at the moment we\u2019ve seen it climb 57%.\" All the food bank representatives who spoke to Fox News Digital shared Lupercio\u2019s concerns about rising food prices and fuel costs.     \n      A mother and her two children receive food at Feeding South Dakota\n       (Feeding South Dakota) CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"Our new reality is simply that demand for food assistance is going up and availability of food is going down,\" Wheeler said. \"Like so many food banks around the country, we must continue to purchase a significant amount of food to help our neighbors who are struggling to make ends meet.\" Inflationary pressures, fuel costs and high demand have represented a \"compounding problem,\" especially when it comes to providing food to people in rural areas, according to Burns. \"Our fuel prices are greatly increased, so the price per pound of our delivered food has greatly increased not only because we're having to buy more of it, but it costs more to get it out there to those in need,\" Burns said. In New Jersey, a food pantry was recently  forced to close down  for the first time ever as\u00a0a result of soaring grocery costs.\u00a0 \"It's like this perfect storm that they've got right now where everything internally is more expensive and there's a greater need for support and increased fuel prices on top of that,\" Olsen said. Inflation accelerated more than expected to a new  four-decade high  in June as the consumer price index, a broad measure of the price for everyday goods, including gasoline, groceries and rents, rose 9.1% from the year before.\u00a0 It marked the fast pace of inflation since December 1981.\u00a0     Andrew Mark Miller is a writer at Fox News.

NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!\n   Democrats who passed their social spending and  taxation bill  Friday wouldn't say exactly when they believe the legislation will start cutting inflation, but they firmly maintained it would, particularly on energy and health care. The comments come as Democrats tout the bill, the Inflation Reduction Act, as one of their  top legislative achievements this Congress.  The bill would raise more than $700 billion in tax revenue and spend more than $400 billion. It now awaits President Biden's signature. But analyses of the bill say it would have very little, if any, effect on inflation. Even Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., said the bill \"will in fact have a minimal impact on inflation.\" Several Democrats who spoke with Fox News Digital on Friday disagreed, even if some did not specify exactly when Americans will feel the bill's effects.     \n      Rep.

Prices were unchanged in the one-month period from June. Those figures were both lower than the 8.7% headline figure and 0.2% monthly gain forecast by Refinitiv economists, likely a welcoming sign for the\u00a0 Federal Reserve \u00a0as it seeks to cool price gains and tame consumer demand.\u00a0 Scorching-hot inflation has created severe financial pressures for most U.S. households, which are forced to pay more everyday necessities like food and rent.

Republican politicians have voiced concern that the plan would not only raise taxes on lower- and middle-class Americans, but could also increase the amount of tax audits, disproportionately affecting citizens who are unable to afford legal counsel. Democrats have repeatedly insisted that the Inflation Reduction Act will not affect those making less than $400,000 or less a year, but FOX Business  recently confirmed  that the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) had informed lawmakers and taxpayers that those under the threshold would still account for around $20 billion in revenue for the legislation. Republicans claim this directly contradicts Biden and other Democrats' promises that no one in the middle- and lower-income brackets would get hit with increased audits. Both CNN and MSNBC admitted in on-air reports that an increase in the amount of taxes collected would allow the IRS to bolster its workforce.\u00a0 Nevertheless, Democrats and prominent media members respectively have called concerns about the IRS funding boost \"preposterous\" and representative of \"MAGA media\u2019s hatred of government.\" MEMBER OF GOP LEADERSHIP SAYS IRS COULD 'BULLY THE MIDDLE CLASS,' TARGET CONSERVATIVES, IF MANCHIN BILL PASSES     \n      The headquarters of the Internal Revenue Service in Washington, April 13, 2014.\n       (AP Photo/J.

Congress passed the sweeping climate, energy and health care bill dubbed the Inflation Reduction Act on Aug. 12 despite concerns from Republican and economists that spending would do little to reduce inflation in the immediate future and only bolster the IRS\u2019s capability to go  after the middle class.

ANALYSIS SUGGESTS INFLATION REDUCTION ACT WILL REDUCE ANNUAL INFLATION BY ONLY 0.1 PERCENTAGE POINTS On the other hand, diverting attention from the Inflation Act could prove a blessing for Democrats, and for  President Biden . The bill is riddled with pitfalls \u2013 at least five \u2013 for the president\u2019s party, giving Republicans much campaign fodder for the months ahead.\u00a0 Pitfall number one: it turns out, the Inflation Reduction Act, passed via reconciliation with only Democrat votes, is a stink bomb.\u00a0 Its very name is so non-credible that even  liberal media outlets  like CNN and the New York Times have dumped the \"Inflation Reduction Act\" handle, and now describe it as the \"Climate and Healthcare Bill.\"   Video That figures; recent polling finds that only 12% of Americans think the package will actually  reduce  the cost of living, while 40% expect it will  increase\u00a0 inflation. CBS REPORT: INFLATION REDUCTION ACT MAY NOT ACTUALLY REDUCE INFLATION That assessment reflects the near-universal repudiation of the legislation\u2019s inflation-fighting credentials by analysts at Penn Wharton and elsewhere. Democrats will struggle to tout an essentially dishonest bill.\u00a0 Pitfall number two: The main focus on the bill is not fighting inflation, but instead fighting climate change, which will likely drive prices higher, not lower.\u00a0 Climate change , according to Gallup does not even register in the top eleven issues Americans are concerned about.\u00a0 ANALYSIS SUGGESTS INFLATION REDUCTION ACT WILL REDUCE ANNUAL INFLATION BY ONLY 0.1 PERCENTAGE POINTS Democrats have allocated hundreds of billions of dollars to push our nation towards greater use of renewable energy. Renewable energy that is more expensive than cheap coal and natural gas, despite claims made by environmental groups, and that will raise electricity costs across the nation.\u00a0   Video Take a look at California, where local legislators have been in the vanguard of imposing renewable energy mandates and where electricity costs 80% more than the national average. The  California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC)  Public Advocates Office cited in a report last year some 17 \"state legislative measures that increase the share of electricity that come from renewable power sources and energy efficiency programs\" and that are raising consumer costs.\u00a0 Because the state is effectively mandating a switch to  electric vehicles  and electric home heating, demand for electricity in the state is expected to soar, and prices too. The CPUC report noted, at $3.27 per gallon for gas, \"it was cheaper to fuel an internal combustion engine vehicle than to charge an EV in the San Diego Gas & Electric Co. service area.\" \u00a0\u00a0 PELOSI SAYS GOP VOTES AGAINST INFLATION REDUCTION ACT WERE AGAINST 'MOTHER EARTH' California is not unique. All but one of the ten states punishing consumers with the nation\u2019s highest electricity costs have renewable energy mandates. The Inflation Reduction Act will dictate such mandates nationwide, increasing electricity prices. The government, as in California, will have to step in to hide the real costs of these policies, and not just by providing taxpayer subsidies for EVs. Pitfall number three: Biden celebrated the Inflation Act\u2019s passage by claiming, \"Today, the American people won. Special interests lost.\" Fat chance. There is no more \"special interest\" than the green lobby, which funnels tens of millions of dollars every  election cycle  to Democrats.   Video According to Open Secrets, the League of Conservation Voters spent over $18 million in the 2020 elections, with more than 99% going to Democrats. The Environmental Defense Fund, the Sierra Club and others also gave heavily to Democrats.

To bring Arizona Democratic Sen. Kyrsten Sinema aboard, the party removed a minor tweak to the carried interest tax law that would have cost wealthy hedge fund and private equity players some $14 billion over the next 10 years.

Because numerous analysts have concluded that it was the over-the-top American Rescue Plan, passed with only Democratic votes, that kicked off inflation.   Video Throwing $1.9 trillion in stimulus onto an economy that was already red-hot caused the price of everything to rise, as billions in checks and other benefits plumped up  consumer bank accounts, savings and spending . Biden and his party have refused to take responsibility for spending our way into an inflationary cycle. But their insistence that a minor (and uncertain) reduction in the deficit can help bring down prices undermines their argument. Pitfall number five: The bill asks Americans to applaud a giant increase in the staffing and powers of the IRS.\u00a0 Imagine:  87,000 new agents  invading that many more small businesses and households. Does any sane person think that will be popular? Or non-political? Or, that the newly-energized audit teams will only pursue high earners?

She merely claimed the bill would \"grow\" other sectors of the economy, hoping the CNN anchor and the audience could accept that as a strategy to lower near 40-year high inflation. Bolduan prompted Rouse, referencing the gulf between the law\u2019s name and its function as described by the CBO. \"Cecilia, Democrats titled this bill the Inflation Reduction Act, which begs, of course, for voters to hold you all accountable to that.

She stated, \"So this bill represents really important investments we know we need to make that help to expand our economic capacity. Inflation happens when we have too much demand for the supply, and we know we need to be investing in the supply supports so that we are better able as a country to address issues like inflation going forward.\" Rouse added, \"So this will increase our economic growth, and because of how we plan to implement it and provisions in the bill, it will \u2014 that growth will be more equitably shared.\" Though this answer wasn\u2019t satisfactory for Bolduan who wanted to know how inflation would be combated by this legislation in the immediate future. The host pressed Rouse again, \"But if you passed a bill called the Fill Every Pothole Act, I mean, voters should expect you to fill every pothole. I mean, so should voters measure the success of this bill on how much you reduce inflation in the next couple of years?\"     \n      The Congressional Budget Office has claimed that the Inflation Reduction Act will have a \"minimal\" impact on inflation.\n       (Composite) HOUSE DEMOCRATS PASS $739B MANCHIN-SCHUMER SPENDING AND TAX INCREASE BILL Rouse answered by talking about how the bill is an investment in the economy that would shape it in the long term. \"So this bill spins out over several years and so the tax provisions, for example, some of the tax revenue will happen immediately, some of the benefits in terms of deficit reduction will materialize over time. So, again, this is really an investment in our economy.\" She added, \"It represents the president\u2019s economic vision for transitioning to an economy that works better for American families by generating the kind of growth that\u2019s based on stable, steady productivity gains in the language of economists, so that kind of growth that we know we need to be making in order to ensure that we continue progressing for the decades to come.\" Bolduan wasn\u2019t too impressed with the word salad, pushing back one more time on the deceptiveness of the bill\u2019s name. \"And a name is just a name.

And this is one of many cases where the Democrats get away with this. Go back and think about bills like the Affordable Care Act to  the Inflation Reduction Act . This is misleading to the American people, and there should be a rule in Congress that makes it against the rules of the House or the Senate to do what  the Democrats have done  this time, again. So I'll tell you one thing that I did do. I introduced a bill in Congress with Senator Rick Scott that would require the CBO to measure the inflationary impact on all the bills that we pass. The CBO tells us how much it will cost, but it doesn't measure inflation. And what happened was when I introduced it in the House, Senator Scott introduced it in the Senate, the Democrats shot it down. And now you know why they don't want that to be measured by the CBO, because they know that in cases like this, it will show that their bills actually make inflation worse. And the more you dig into this bill, the worse it is. It taxes natural gas. So it means that you're going to pay more for energy. It's going to kill energy jobs in America. And then on top of that, the 87,000 new IRS agents, Notre Dame's football stadium couldn't hold 87,000 new IRS agents. And they're coming after working-class Americans, $20 billion in new taxes on them. And IRS agents are coming after people who work hourly, make a good living. And that's what the Democrats support. So the more you learn about it, the more reason there is to be very cautious and wary of what the Democrats have put forward in this case.\u00a0 WATCH THE INTERVIEW BELOW:   Video     This article was written by Fox News staff."},

NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!\n   People say the federal government seems big, maybe bigger than ever. Well, it actually is the largest employer in the world. The federal government, nothing else comes close\u2014not Google, not Amazon, not the Communist Party of China, nothing. How many people work for the United States government? Let's put it this way. There are more than 100 countries around the world whose total populations (that is, every man, woman and child) are smaller than our federal workforce\u2014entire countries, many of them. \u00a0 The U.S. government, in other words, is astoundingly large, world historically big, scale without precedent, truly gargantuan. So, what do all those people who work there do every day? You may be wondering that. Well, it's a good question. Actually, nobody's really sure, including many of the employees themselves. Fundamentally, the federal government is a mystery. Like the universe, it goes on forever. It makes you feel small thinking about it, which is probably the point.\u00a0 The good news is, every once in a while, our government does something you can actually understand. That happened recently when Joe Biden signed a $750 billion piece of legislation called the  Inflation Reduction Act . What does the Inflation Reduction Act do? Come on, what are you, slow? The answer is right there in the name. The Inflation Reduction Act is an act that reduces inflation. It's an inflation-reducing act and that's welcome news because inflation is indeed a problem. In fact, voters say it's the problem they worry about most. \u00a0 So, Congress has decided to reduce it. That's how things work in Washington. You would identify a crisis, and then you pass a law making it illegal. Crisis solved. It's simple. Getting too hot for you in the summer? No problem, just have Congress write a law banning high temperatures. That's effectively our climate change policy and as we know, it works. The science on that has been settled. Don't deny it. Now, Congress has decided to bring that very same approach to inflation. Just command it to go down. \u00a0 TRUDEAU CELEBRATES CANADIAN WINDFALL FROM BIDEN SIGNING INFLATION REDUCTION ACT \u00a0   Video You can imagine how terrified inflation will be when it discovers it's being reduced by our all-powerful Congress. \"Wait,\" it'll say in horror, \"You passed an Inflation Reduction Act? Okay, fine. I surrender. Gas is now $1.50 a gallon. Hamburgers, two bucks a pound. Sorry for the high prices.\" That's the promise of this act anyway, but in real life, a lot of people are still wondering, \"How is this going to work?\"\u00a0 Hilary Vaughn from Fox was wondering that, so\u00a0yesterday she caught up with Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia. Manchin is the man, the single man whose vote made this bill possible. \"Is the Inflation Reduction Act really going to reduce inflation?\" she asked. Here's how Joe Manchin responded: HILLARY VAUGHN:  When it comes to inflation, is it misleading to call this the \"Inflation Reduction Act\" for Americans when it's not going to make their grocery bill cheaper, it's not going to make every day goods cheaper for them?\u00a0 SEN. JOE MANCHIN:  Why would it? Why would it? Well, immediately, it's not. We've never seen anything happen immediately, like turn the switch on and off. \u00a0 BIDEN SIGNS $739 BILLION INFLATION REDUCTION ACT INTO LAW, SLAMS GOP FOR VOTING AGAINST THE TAX, CLIMATE DEAL \u00a0 So, as Hillary Vaughn pointed out correctly the law won't immediately make anything cheaper to buy. In other words, it will not  reduce inflation , but Joe Manchin didn't deny this. He didn't seem bothered by it. In fact, his response was, \"Why would it?\" Well, let's see, because you told us it would, you dishonest little creep, and then you printed another $750 billion of fake money, which is exactly the habit that caused historic inflation in the first place, all this fake money printing. \u00a0So, what's the upside of this bill exactly? Joe Manchin didn't say. Congressman Jamie Raskin of Maryland couldn't explain it either. Watch this. \u00a0 REP. JAMIE RASKIN: \u00a0I know that those who have been blaming President Biden for the inflation going up are now giving President Biden all the credit for inflation going down, so we're moving things in the right direction already. \u00a0 REPORTER:  And what parts of the bill do you think will quickly work on that specifically? \u00a0 RASKIN:\u00a0 Next question.\u00a0 SEN. TOM COTTON\u2019S 2022 MISSION TO \u2018PUT THE BRAKES\u2019 ON BIDEN\u2019S AGENDA MAY BE PRELUDE FOR POTENTIAL 2024 RUN \u00a0 \"I'm Jamie Raskin. I'll say anything.\"\u00a0 \"What parts of the Inflation Reduction Act will actually reduce inflation?\"\u00a0 \"Next question,\" says Raskin. He actually said that out loud, as you just saw. In other words, \"You've caught me lying and I don't even care. Go away, peasant.\" So, as it turns out, we hate to break this to you, the Inflation Reduction Act may be a classic example of misinformation. Imagine buying a bottle labeled \"shampoo\" and finding out the hard way it was actually drain cleaner. It's like that. So, if there's one thing we can learn from the so-called  Inflation Reduction Act , it's that in Washington, words no longer have any meaning at all.\u00a0 The empire has officially entered its postmodern phase, where there's no connection whatsoever between the sounds that emerge from the mouths of our leaders and observable physical reality. Congress might as well have called this the Eternal Happiness Act. And why not? That's probably the name of the next bill Joe Biden signs and we hope so, because we are long overdue for Washington to ban sadness. They ought to get on that, not that this bill was even thought about by Joe Biden, not that he even noticed this bill. Biden doesn't get too caught up in the meaning of words these days. Biden is definitively post-literate at this point. Here was the scene as he signed his most recent legislative triumph.\u00a0 WHITE HOUSE ECONOMIC ADVISER CLAIMS $739 BILLION INFLATION REDUCTION ACT 'MORE THAN PAYS FOR ITSELF' \u00a0     \n      President Biden speaks about inflation and supply chain issues in Los Angeles.\u00a0\n       (AP Photo/Damian Dovarganes) PRESIDENT BIDEN:  OK.\u00a0 SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER:  It's now law.\u00a0 Here we go. They might as well put a sign on his desk saying, \"This guy has no idea what he's doing right now\" because he didn't and it couldn't have been more obvious. The thousand-yard stare was the giveaway. There were doughboys in Verdun who looked less shell shocked than Biden just did, but the question remained, \"What was in the bill?\" Well, let's see. You'll be happy to know that this bill, the Inflation Reduction Act, includes $3 billion for the U.S. Postal Service to buy new electric mail trucks. \u00a0 So, why would your mailman need an electric mail truck? No one has ever explained that, but your mailman is getting one and China is getting even richer from the electric mail truck batteries, which it makes. So, there's that. Then there's another $3 billion allocated to block grants for something called environmental justice that will be overseen by the EPA, which used to look after the environment, but now it's in the justice business. Environmental justice gets about $60 billion in this legislation, which is great if you're in the environmental justice business, but it leaves the rest of us wondering, \"What is environmental justice actually?\" \u00a0 CHRIS HAYES PROCLAIMS BIDEN SIGNING INFLATION REDUCTION ACT A 'HUGE DAY FOR THE COUNTRY, THE PLANET, EVERYONE' \u00a0 Well, according to the bill, it means and we are quoting here, \"facilitating engagement of disadvantaged communities in state and federal advisory groups, workshops, rulemaking and other public processes.\" OK. That sounds confusing, but also expensive. In all, the EPA alone gets more than $40 billion in this bill, including more than $30 billion for so-called disadvantaged communities. What are those? Well, they're not really defined, people who vote for Joe Biden. So, what it really means is the EPA is going to spread more identity politics and race hate. Are you sick of that yet? The Biden White House is not sick of it. They're all in. \u00a0 For context, to show you just how all in they are on that, the total annual budget of the EPA currently stands at about $10 billion. So, this is a lot of money flowing to equity and the disadvantaged and of course, everything hangs on definitions. So, who gets to define what disadvantages, a disadvantaged community? Well, that would be the EPA's administrator, a guy called Michael Regan,\u00a0 This is a guy who's in his late forties who has never had an actual job in his life, never worked for real business of any kind, but he does have priorities and to give you some sense of what they are, we'll tell you what he told The Daily Show this year and we're quoting, \"Everything I do at EPA is through the lens of environmental justice, contracting, procurement, air quality, water quality, land management, starts with 'Are we protecting the least among us, those who have lacked political representation and those who have not been at the table for decades\u2019?\"\u00a0 So really, this is about spreading race hate as virtually everything they do is. They call it equity. It's not about protecting the environment and if you're wondering how the environment's doing, take a very close look.Is anyone monitoring the chemicals in our water? No. We're busy conducting workshops for billions of dollars with disadvantaged communities. Right. That may not be helping the environment, but it's definitely not reducing inflation. \u00a0 Inflation reduction is not the same as protecting people who lack political representation. That's, of course, Joe Biden's base, the 81 million who voted for him. That's what this bill is really about, rewarding his voters. That would include virtually every bureaucrat in Washington. They do very well on this bill, of course, as long as they promise to spend it on equity, however, they want to define that. \u00a0 REPORTERS BLASTED FOR ABANDONING INFLATION REDUCTION ACT TITLE WITH BILL SIGNING: 'AREN'T EVEN TRYING ANYMORE' \u00a0   Video There's $25 million for the Government Accountability Office to determine, \"whether the economic, social and environmental impacts of the funds described in this paragraph are equitable.\" The bill also calls for $10 million to be spent on \"equity commissions\" within the Department of Agriculture to combat racism. In other words, to commit racism. Really, not since the German government 80 years ago has any government ever pay closer attention to people's genetics. That's true and yet no one notices it for some reason. Well, we do. \u00a0 There's more than $2 billion for the General Services Administration. Something called the Federal Permitting Improvement Steering Council, that gets $350 million. The Bureau of Indian Affairs gets $220 million. The Office of Native Hawaiian Relations gets $23 million and it's not just bureaucrats who are getting paid. There are billions of dollars in new tax credits. Who do those go to? Joe Biden's donors. Of course, not to you. Are you in private equity? No, you're not, so\u00a0you don't get anything. Biden described these credits yesterday. \u00a0 PRESIDENT BIDEN:  The Inflation Reduction Act, invests $369 billion to take the most aggressive action ever, ever, ever, ever, in confronting the climate crisis and strengthening our economic, our energy security. It's going to offer working families thousands of dollars in savings by providing them rebates to buy new and efficient appliances, weatherize their homes, get tax credit for purchasing heat pumps and rooftop solar, electric stoves, ovens, dryers. \u00a0 WHITE HOUSE NOT SAYING WHEN THE INFLATION REDUCTION ACT WILL BEGIN TO CUT INFLATION \u00a0 So, you watch that and you realize maybe they are going to run him again because he doesn't actually exist. He is merely a conduit through which they change America. He has no idea what he's saying. He reads the script. He seems kind of non-threatening and out of it. That may seem embarrassing to you, a problem to you. You wonder, \"What does his wife think of all this? It's so demeaning and degrading. It's cruel to do this to a guy, feed him full of drugs and having read someone else's script,\" but if you're trying to change the country really fast, this is very useful to you, so of course, they're going to run him again. \u00a0 So, again to the bill, a nonprofit called Rewiring America, which supports this bill, decided to figure out how much money Americans are eligible to receive from the Inflation Reduction Act based on zip code, household income, tax filing status. So, according to Rewiring America, a married couple with one child in San Francisco earning the median household income there of $120,000 would be eligible for nearly $12,000 in tax credits, but according to that same group, that same family of three making the median income in Youngstown, Ohio, for example, would be eligible for just $81 in tax credits. Oh, that's weird. So, the middle-class kid shafted while people making 120 grand in San Francisco make out. OK. \u00a0 So, most Americans who are making middle-class wages will be eligible for more savings only if they're willing to go out and spend thousands of dollars on things like a new heat pump water heater, an electric stove or a heat pump closed dryer. Right, none of which work very well, but the bigger issue is that all these tax credits for Joe Biden's base are going to increase inflation. This is the same thing that happened to college tuition when the government subsidized it. It got much more expensive. Perfect, and that's already started. As The Washington Examiner has reported, electric vehicle manufacturers are now raising the price of their cars now that the so-called Inflation Reduction Act includes a $770,500 tax credit for electric vehicles, \"Ahead of the Inflation Reduction Act, extending the tax credit of up to $7,500 for purchases of new electric and hybrid vehicles, Ford and GM announced price increases at similar rates.\" You following this? \u00a0 WILL CAIN: WHY IS JOE BIDEN HIRING ALL OF THESE IRS AGENTS? \u00a0   Video So, the government pays you back your own money to buy a product and then the manufacturer of the product raises the cost of that same product by the same amount. Oh, so it's a subsidy for them, not savings for you. \"Last week, Ford announced price hikes between $6,000 and $8,500 for most of its lineup of its F-150 lightning electric vehicles, while General Motors upped its electric Hummer costs by $6,250 last month.\"\u00a0 So, what does that? They don't want to answer the question because the only potentially deflationary aspect of this bill is the tax increase, which is, of course, probably not a good idea when you're in a recession, but our government is not willing to cut spending and stop printing money, so instead their solution is to take money from you. This is classic, right? So, you print all the money you want because you hold the reserve currency and then when inflation goes up, you just try and pull it out of the system through taxation. That's modern monetary theory. Look it up. According to the Congressional Budget Office, this act will cost the middle-class $20 billion a year in new taxes. The Joint Committee on Taxation has concluded that under this bill, 61% of taxpayers make between $40,000 and $50,00\u00a0will see a tax increase. \u00a0 91% of Americans make between $75,000 and $100,000 will see their taxes go up and 97% of Americans make between $100,000 and $200,000\u00a0will see their taxes go up. So, if you're making 100 grand in Arlington, Virginia, are you rich? Oh, no. You're barely scraping by. So, it turns out that Biden was lying. Just yesterday, he told us that no one making under $400,000 a year will see their taxes go up. Watch.\u00a0 BIDEN SLAMMED FOR SIGNING INFLATION REDUCTION ACT: \u2018DARK DAY FOR EVERYDAY AMERICANS\u2019 \u00a0     \n      President Joe Biden holds a press conference.\n       (Fox News\u00a0) BIDEN:  And I'm keeping my campaign commitment. No one, let me emphasize, no one earning less than $400,000 a year will pay a penny more in federal taxes. Folks.\u00a0 \u00a0 Yeah. Not a penny more. I mean, again, you can't blame the guy. He's just a mannequin, but whoever wrote that knew he was lying. There is one group of Americans who will not pay more under that bill and that's Biden's donors, the richest people in the country. Thanks to the Democratic Party's hedge fund support, and they have a lot of that, the private equity world, the final revision of this bill keeps the carried interest loophole in our tax code. That means that people who work in finance, many parts of finance, are able to report their income as interest and pay half the taxes that you do. No one can defend this policy. It is indefensible. Even the people who benefit from it will not defend it. They're embarrassed of it. They take advantage of it, of course, but it's a scam and everybody knows it and yet it remains in our tax code because they paid off the Democratic senator from Arizona and a bunch of others. \u00a0 So, just in case the message wasn't clear, the bill gives the IRS another $80 billion to hire 87,000 new auditors. So, what are those new auditors, those armed auditors of the IRS have to do with a tax code this unfair? Well, the truth is, if you have a tax code this unfair and it keeps getting more unfair every year, you have to hire armed goons to make people obey because they won't otherwise. 87,000 new armed IRS agents. How many is that? Well, for perspective, the IRS currently has about 78,000 total. So, this bill will make the IRS larger than the army of the nation of Italy, also the nation of the Philippines, also the U.K.. What? Thanks, Joe Manchin.\u00a0 So, what are those agents going to be doing? We're not sure, but we do have an IRS training video for you. Watch. \u00a0 UNDERCOVER AGENT:   In addition to being accountants, we're also law enforcement officers, which is very interesting because a lot of the special agents that work for the IRS, they don't come from a law enforcement background. We get to do the same things like all the other law enforcement officers do. Things happen. We have to be able to respond, so we have to be ready. \u00a0 CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \u00a0 IRS SPECIAL AGENT:  So, we teach our agents to fire a firearm, to be able to shoot. We teach them defensive tactics and methods of defending themselves and protecting others as well. So, they go through that entire process so that not only can they analyze records, but they also have that law enforcement component. \u00a0 So, in an actual democracy, IRS agents should be taught to be polite, but under Joe Biden, IRS agents are taught \"to shoot.\" How is that not war on the population of the country? \u00a0 \u00a0     Tucker Carlson currently serves as the host of FOX News Channel\u2019s (FNC) Tucker Carlson Tonight (weekdays 8PM/ET).

NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!\n   Buying a  used electric car  is going to get a lot cheaper for some shoppers in the near future, but not everyone. Along with an  updated federal tax credit  scheme for new plug-in car purchases, the recently passed Inflation Reduction Act includes the first credit for used electric car purchases. It doesn't go into effect until 2024 and won't apply to a lot of the cars you find on Craigslist or Facebook Marketplace, however. The credit is only available for vehicles that are sold through a licensed dealer for $25,000 or less and have been in service for at least two years. It is only valid for the first time a vehicle is being resold from new. NEW EV TAX CREDIT APPEARS TO BE LIMITED BY CONDITIONS     \n      The new federal used car tax credit applies only to vehicles sold for $25,000 or less.\n       (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) The amount of the credit is $4,000 or 30%, whichever is lower, so it maxes out on vehicles priced below $13,500, but income limits also apply and are half of those for the new electric car credit. Single-filers are restricted to $75,000 gross annual income, head-of-households to $112,500 and couples to $150,000. The National Independent Automobile Dealers Association, which represents the used car dealer industry,  told Fox News Digital  that it doesn't think the credit will benefit the used EV market much due to the restrictions.     \n      Fully electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles will qualify for the used car tax credit.\n       (Mario Tama/Getty Images) \"According to the provisions laid out in the IRA, the parameters for any consumer that is in search of a used EV would be extremely difficult,\" the organization said. \"Our members serve all levels of income and for those families within the criteria of the joint filing \u2013 most likely families with one, two or three children \u2013 this criteria limits the choices of finding a used EV under $25,000 that is two years old and makes it almost impossible. This criteria, while a good start, leaves more questions than answers on how our dealers and the consumers we service can receive these credits.\" ELECTRIC CAR TAX CREDIT: THESE ARE ALL OF THE VEHICLES THAT STILL QUALIFY \u2026 FOR NOW Unlike the new car credit, the used cars don't need to meet increasingly stringent domestic manufacturing and materials sourcing rules that have already eliminated all but 21 plug-in vehicles from eligibility, and Consumer Reports says that leaves buyers with a choice to make. \"If you\u2019re interested in an EV or a plug-in hybrid and it qualifies for a tax credit today, don\u2019t wait, because it might not qualify next year. But if you\u2019re considering a used EV, it might be worth waiting,\" Jake Fisher, senior director of Consumer Reports\u2019 Auto Test Center said. GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE Used car chain CarMax  wouldn't say how it expects the program to affect sales, but said it supports the change.     \n      Sales of used EVs have doubled at CarMax over the past two years.\n       (Mario Tama/Getty Images) \"We are pleased about the used\u00a0EV tax credit included in the Inflation Reduction Act signed into law,\" the company said. \"In the last two years, CarMax\u2019s retail sales of used electric and hybrid vehicles have more than doubled \u2013 making EVs one of our fastest growing categories.\"     Gary Gastelu is Fox News Digital's Automotive Editor."},

Axne is being challenged by former Iowa state House Republican Rep. Zach Nunn, while Porter faces a challenge from Republican Scott Baugh, a graduate from Liberty University. Prior to the House's passage of the measure,  Senate Democrats  projected that enhancing IRS funding could add an extra $124 billion in federal revenue over the next decade by hiring more tax enforcers who can crack down on rich individuals and corporations attempting to evade taxes.     \n      The Internal Revenue Service federal building in Washington, D.C.\n       (iStock) CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP However, Republicans warned the bill would fund an \"army\" of IRS agents to crack down on small business owners and lower-income workers. Americans who earn less than $75,000 per year are slated to receive 60% of the additional tax audits expected  under the Democrats' spending package , according to an analysis released by House Republicans. House Republican  analysis  showed that individuals with an annual income of $75,000 or less would be subject to 710,863 additional IRS audits, while those making more than $1 million would receive 52,295 more audits under the bill. Overall, the IRS would conduct more than 1.2 million more annual audits of Americans' tax returns, according to the analysis.

Some teachers create Amazon wish lists for classroom supplies, which they may share on social media for readers to buy and donate the items. Such lists posted on Twitter include disinfectant wipes, power strips, classroom decorations, snacks, dry erase markers and highlighters. Fewer Donations to 'Wish Lists' Kindergarten teacher Melissa Hunt, 53, from Albany, New York, has noticed higher prices and fewer donations to her Amazon.com Educator Wish List. Last year she cleared her list in three days, but this year it has remained online for weeks and prompted a donation of only $12, she said.

NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!\n   In his latest column for the New York Times, economist and author  Paul Krugman  acknowledged that President Joe Biden has \"accomplished a lot\" in office but admitted that the accomplishments \"don\u2019t look as impressive when you compare them with the scale of the nation\u2019s problems.\" Krugman began by describing the recent flip in the media assessment of Biden's presidency after he signed the Inflation Reduction Act into law earlier this week. The columnist wrote, \"Seriously, it has been amazing to watch the media narrative on the Biden administration change.\" \"Just a few weeks ago President Biden was portrayed as hapless, on the edge of presiding over a failed presidency.

Kansas voters rejected a state constitutional amendment to allow restrictions on abortion. Abortion, a major midterm issue following the Supreme Court's June decision to  overturn Roe v. Wade  and return the issue to the states, got its first test on the ballot earlier this summer. Kansas voters took to the polls to reject, by an overwhelming margin, an amendment to make it easier for lawmakers to ban abortion in the state.

Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., after months of negotiations. The bill was quickly pushed through the House and Senate for a vote, before heading to the President's desk where it was signed into law.     \n      Biden recently signed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 into law.\n       (Drew Angerer/Getty Images) The new climate and tax legislation received serious backlash, after several reports found that the IRS provision in the bill would hire approximately 87,000 new agents and potentially increase audits on working-class Americans. The Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) reported the bill would increase taxes on individuals making less than $400k per year and have little impact on inflation reduction. Several polls suggest that the Democrat's focus on  climate change  and access to abortion are motivating their base more than tackling inflation and economic concerns, which could indicate that recent legislation addressing climate change, and pushback on the SCOTUS abortion decision, are factors in Biden's slight boost in approval and a more favorable Senate outlook.

STUDENT LOAN CANCELLATION COULD COST $900B AND FAVOR TOP EARNERS, ANALYSIS SHOWS Progressives and liberals have hounded the president to provide broader relief to hard-hit borrowers, while moderates and Republicans have questioned the fairness of any widespread forgiveness. The nation's federal student debt now tops $1.6 trillion after ballooning for years. More than 43 million Americans have federal student debt, with almost a third owing less than $10,000 and more than half owing less than $20,000, according to the latest federal data. Pandemic-era payment freezes were set to end on Aug. 31. On the campaign trail, Biden proposed canceling up to $10,000 per borrower, with no mention of an income cap. But the president has narrowed that promise in recent months by embracing the income limit as soaring inflation took a political toll and as he aimed to head off political attacks that the cancellation would benefit those with higher take-home pay.     \n      President Biden delivers remarks before signing the Inflation Reduction Act at the White House.\n       (Drew Angerer/Getty Images) According to a  recent  analysis  from the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB), the $10,000 forgiveness plan would undermine the recently passed Inflation Reduction Act by consuming nearly 10 years of deficit reduction and wipe out disinflationary benefits.

But when asked if the plan would increase inflation, a senior administration official said the steps the Biden administration is taking will offset each other, noting there are \"certain conditions and assumptions under which it could well be neutral or deflationary.\"\u00a0     The official said that the \"combination\" of an extension in the pause in loan payments and the \"targeted debt relief\" will \"largely offset\" inflation.\u00a0 \"That's our view,\" the official said, adding that \"if all borrowers claim the relief that they are entitled to, 43 million federal student loan borrowers will benefit, and of those, 20 million will have their debt completely canceled.\" Biden on Wednesday said that under his new plan, \"nearly 45% can have their student debt fully canceled.\"\u00a0 \"That's 20 million people who can start getting on with their lives,\" Biden said.\u00a0 But the student loan cancellation doesn't help all student loan borrowers.

Surrounded by Republican  and Democratic lawmakers who worked together to pass the bill, Republican Gov. Henry McMaster held a signing ceremony Thursday for the law he put his signature to back in May. The law provides the six weeks of leave at full salary for the primary parent or caretaker of a baby and two weeks for the other parent for both natural births and adoptions. It also provides two weeks paid leave for foster parents who take in a new child. \"Mamas and daddies need to be with their babies as much as they can,\" McMaster said. State agencies are being told about the leave and the rules this week, said Karen Wingo, state human resources director at the Department of Administration. SOUTH CAROLINA SUPREME COURT TEMPORARILY BLOCKS ABORTION LAW AS NEAR-TOTAL BAN MOVES FORWARD IN STATE HOUSE The new law has a special place in her heart because Wingo's children, now 3 and 5, were born while she worked for the state and she said she did \"everything from kissed boo boos and wiped runny noses, dried tears, given snacks, attempted to entertain children\" while working. \"One time my 2-year-old decided it was a good time to yell into the phone while I was briefing the governor,\" Wingo said. \"I know how hard it can be to be a working parent.\"     \n      A new law in South Carolina will entitle parents to six weeks of paid time off following the birth or adoption of a child.

The House approved 12 weeks of leave, but senators had to work to get their body to agree to six,  Democratic Sen. Darrell Jackson  said. Jackson backed the bill after a woman in his office who looked too sick to work as her pregnancy ended told him she had to save every sick day and vacation day she could to spend just a few weeks with her new baby. As the Republican-dominated General Assembly considers a near-total  abortion ban , Jackson said they need to consider bumping leave up to 12 weeks and take other steps to ensure health and child care to support children after they are born. \"I would challenge us to be pro-quality life,\" Jackson said.

Over 150 people were lined up in Dublin on Tuesday night to view a three-bedroom house on the market for roughly $1,800 per month as the area deals with a housing shortage that has caused Dublin real estate agents to implement a lottery system for viewings,  The Daily Mail reported . Ireland\u2019s booming economy has brought an influx of employees into the country who are able to afford higher housing prices. This increased demand has contributed to costs going up. A shortage of properties has also exacerbated a crisis that traces back to the Irish government's housing policies, one expert told Fox News Digital. \"They do have a demand for more housing but what they haven\u2019t done is keep up with it by creating a supply,\" Cato Institute Senior Fellow Michael D.

On Wednesday, Biden made the announcement that the White House would plan to  pay off at least $300 billion  of the $1.6 trillion national student loan debt. Although several Democrats agreed with the news, some mainstream media outlets have casted doubt over the success of the president's plan. CNN guest co-host Kaitlan Collins, however, noted that the handouts will \"help a lot of people,\" leading Avlon to lavish praise on the announcement. \"There has been a lot of debate over who benefits, who doesn't, is this a good decision, is it a bad decision.

After reading the story of a woman in her 50s who borrowed $29,000 for NYU School of Law and now owes over $200,000 in her 90s, Goldberg became visibly angry.\u00a0 \"You talk about people can\u2019t buy gas, they can\u2019t buy food, they can\u2019t put their children through any kind of college \u2014 that\u2019s because they\u2019re paying off these freaking student debts,\" she said.\u00a0 CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Goldberg added that those are the kind of debts \"you need to forgive.\" Nearly every major media organization has since become far more outspoken about serious issues surrounding Biden\u2019s plan.

So basically what's happening here is the more money we put into the Pell Grant program and the student loan programs, all the universities do to respond to it is raise their tuition. So it's like a dog chasing its tail. So what I think the solution should be, and maybe we could get a bipartisan consensus, if somebody goes to Stanford, and they're making $125,000 a year, why isn't Stanford on the line for that unpaid loan rather than taxpayers?

Twice in my life Democrats have seriously abused the tax powers, most recently for purely partisan reasons.  Barack Obama silenced conservatives  in 2012 and 2016 by blocking them from forming nonprofit corporations if they had conservative sounding names, and no one stopped him. My own experience with the IRS dates to the 1990s and Bill Clinton. I was writing novels and having some success. My books were on the New York Times and other bestseller lists, and foolish me, I bought a new toy \u2013 a 32-foot trawler called \"Tortuga.\" Turtle in Spanish.     \n      More money for the IRS under the Inflation Reduction Act has many concerned about increased audits for taxpayes.\u00a0\n       (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images \u00a0| \u00a0Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images) This slow boat was the red flag that brought me to the attention of the IRS. Why I don\u2019t know. We never took deductions on her. We were always overly cautious about taxes. I wrote at home, but took no home office deduction, one of the IRS\u2019 notorious red flags. I took no car deduction. My only expenses were printing paper, computer depreciation and business travel. DEMOCRATS HIRE ARMY OF AGENTS AT IRS TO SQUEEZE HONEST TAXPAYERS FOR GREEN NEW DEAL My IRS auditor  \u2013 I think she\u2019d just graduated from high school \u2013 announced that no one had a right to buy such a lavish boat.\u00a0She wanted pictures. I provided them. She wanted to know why I\u2019d purchased it. For pleasure, I said. She acted as if I was hiding something. Her comments caused me to conclude that the audit was rapidly degenerating into an exercise in class warfare. She demanded every scrap of paper regarding travel. We spent months in an endless paper chase, none of which was sufficient. She objected to much of my travel being in Mexico and the Caribbean.   Video I explained that all my business travel was to locations that I showed in my books. I always traveled there alone, always short term, and always within the limits of permissible tax deductions. I gave her copies of my published works that corresponded with photographs of alleys and vacant lots where I\u2019d set murders or other events. I explained that if my readers ever traveled to these locations, I wanted them to see authenticity in my research. None of it made a dent. My auditor disallowed all my business travel, then expanded the audit to embrace additional tax years. When I asked her for legal authority supporting her decision, she told me \u2013 and this is a direct quote \u2013 \"I am all the authority you need.\" BIDEN'S FEDERAL OVERREACH STARTED WITH OBAMA I asked my CPA if we should hire a tax attorney. He said: \"Absolutely not! Hire a tax lawyer, and the IRS will refer the matter to the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office. They\u2019ll most likely open a criminal investigation for tax fraud, even if there\u2019s no evidence. Two years later they might drop the matter. By then you\u2019ll owe several hundred thousand dollars in legal fees. It\u2019s what the IRS and the government do.\"   Video So we took it on the chin. Then it happened: manna from heaven. National news stories revealed serious abuses by the IRS. Countless audits had been conducted without proper cause. Auditors had displayed personal vendettas against taxpayers. One Midwest supervisor, nicknamed \"King James,\" actually exhorted his workers each morning by saying: \"Now let\u2019s go out and beat up some more taxpayers.\" Bill Clinton balked . He told Treasury to get answers and stop the abuses \u2013 now! DEMOCRATS' TAX-AND-SPEND EXTRAVAGANZA WILL TURN IRS INTO INTERNAL REPRESSION SERVICE My CPA saw his opening. He demanded a conference call with my auditor\u2019s supervisor. Under the political gun, she agreed. I listened. My CPA talked. He was interrupted several times by the anxious auditor who tried to defend her conduct to her boss, until he asked the dynamite question \u2013 \"What about this boat?\" My auditor hemmed and hawed. You could smell evasion over the speakerphone.   Video \"My client\u2019s corporation didn\u2019t buy his boat,\" said my CPA. \"It never owned the boat. The boat was a personal asset. It had never been chartered or rented. It produced no income \u2013 only endless expenses \u2013 none of which were ever claimed on taxes.\" \"Give us a minute,\" said the supervisor. The line went dead. My accountant smiled. When the speaker came alive again, the supervisor had an entirely different tone. He announced the 14-month audit was closed. We owned no taxes, penalties, or interest. The word \"sorry\" is not in the IRS lexicon. All that was left was a $100,000 bill to my CPA.

An estimate by the Austin Ending Community Homelessness Coalition (ECHO) last year found about 3,160 people were homeless.\u00a0 The lack of transparency motivated Hammonds to set out and document the homeless crisis himself, posting photos and videos of the dozens of homeless encampments throughout the city on Twitter and  creating a map  that shows the extent of the problem.\u00a0 His project kicked into high gear earlier this year when he saw a group of children walking out of woods littered with  trash and needles  near Great Hills, a neighborhood in northwest Austin.\u00a0 \"I have a soft spot on my heart for children, for one, and that's what really got me, seeing those children in that mess,\" Hammonds told Fox. \"And the other part is the homeless, and seeing them suffer.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!\n   Florida Democratic Senate candidate Val Demings appeared to try to convince voters not to think too much about inflation during a recent speaking engagement, claiming  constitutional issues like abortion  are more important. During a virtual program hosted by the Florida Democratic Party Jewish Caucus, Demimgs was asked what \"the number one issue\" was that she wants to focus on. While  inflation was not  at the top of her list, she did begin her answer by referencing it. \"Give me a little while to go around the fence here to answer your question, because what we're seeing with inflation, what we're seeing with the price of goods and services, gas at the pumps- of course, people are feeling that every day. But let's kind of tuck this away over here,\" said Demings, who will face incumbent Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., in November. The  Senate hopeful  and current House member then pointed to the Inflation Reduction Act, claiming that it \"will help tremendously with some of those issues,\" even though studies and even far-left Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., have said it will not do much of anything to solve the problem of inflation. DEMOCRATS MADE ABORTION THE CENTERPIECE OF MIDTERMS MESSAGE, BUT MANY WON'T EXPLAIN THEIR OWN POSITION   Video Having set the inflation issue aside, Demings then answered the question by saying that her big focus is \"the threat to constitutional rights,\" citing the  Supreme Court's  recent decision overturning Roe v. Wade,. The ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization reversed the Court's previous position that abortion was a constitutional right. \"What I see, this former police chief, as the biggest threat facing our nation right now is the threat to constitutional rights. And along with that comes this effort to divide us, not to unite us, when we see, for example, Roe v. Wade that passed 49 years ago, and then see the efforts \u2013 effortlessly \u2013 to just overturn that ruling, to take away a woman\u2019s constitutional right to choose, constitutional right to privacy.\" GOP CANDIDATE CORY MILLS, VYING FOR OPEN FLORIDA HOUSE SEAT, SAYS HIS COMMUNITY HURTING DUE TO INFLATION     \n      U.S. Rep. Val Demings, asked what her number one issue is, pointed \u00a0to constitutional rights and abortion, not inflation. (John McCall/South Florida Sun-Sentinel via AP)\n       (Associated Press) To those who may say they are not concerned about abortion, Demings said they should be. \"Don\u2019t do that,\" she said. \"Discrimination of any kind, we have to call\u00a0it out. We can never tolerate it. Because it might be on somebody else\u2019s street today, but if we create a belief that discrimination over here is okay, believe me, it\u2019ll be on your street tomorrow.\" Demings then pointed to Justice Clarence Thomas\u2019s concurring opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization, in which he supported reviewing other cases that recognized other rights not specified in the Constitution, such as gay marriage, the right to engage in private, consensual sex acts, and the right of married couples to get contraceptives. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Fox News reached out to the Demings campaign about why she framed her answer the way she did. In a response, a campaign spokesperson did not address that question, but they did stress that Demings is concerned about both inflation and abortion. In a statement, the spokesperson noted that Demings is \"the daughter of a maid and a janitor,\" and this \"knows inflation is an important issue.\" The statement went on to tout legislation Demings supported \"to help lower the price of goods, create American jobs, and lower energy and healthcare costs,\" which the spokesperson said Rubio opposed. A Fox News poll released earlier this month showed that inflation remains voters' number one issue, with 41% citing it as the most important for their vote. Abortion was a distant second with 14% saying it was their top concern.    "},

NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!\n   The biased mainstream media are in overdrive, once again interfering with the rapidly approaching 2022 midterm elections. A veritable onslaught of curiously similar headlines such as \"Democrats see the once unthinkable: A narrow path to keeping the House\" and \"Democrats\u2019 midterm prospects perk up as Biden finally hits his stride\" are all designed to change the political narrative and make people think that America under the leadership of  President Joe Biden and total Democrat  control of Congress isn\u2019t so bad. \u00a0 The precipitous slide to socialism requires a robust effort by the left-wing establishment to make every-day Americans comfortable with the alarming \"new normal\" that\u2019s settling in around us \u2014\u00a0high crime, open borders, high cost of living, out-of-control spending \u2014\u00a0and that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing unfold right before our eyes. So, with less than 70 days to go until Election Day, it\u2019s high time for a reality check. \u00a0 On the same day Biden told us that  \"the economy is looking good,\"  his own Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said that \"while higher interest rates, slower growth, and softer labor market conditions will bring down inflation, they will also bring some pain to households and businesses.\" This is code for \"buckle up, folks.\" This breathtaking contradiction from the two primary leaders who make our economic decisions should tell you all you need to know. Things are not OK in Biden\u2019s America.\u00a0 PRESIDENT BIDEN BOTCHES AR-15 FACTS WHILE STUMPING AGAINST GUN VIOLENCE IN PENNSYLVANIA In the wake of the unprecedented raid of former President Donald Trump\u2019s home that was ordered by Biden\u2019s hand-picked, politicized attorney general on August 8 \u2014\u00a0along with the insane media frenzy that\u2019s followed \u2014 it\u2019s almost easy to forget that we\u2019re in the midst of an economic recession that was first reported on July 28. If you\u2019re a Democrat, you must be feeling pretty blessed to be the beneficiary of such wonderful timing. The White House\u2019s insistence that they knew nothing of the FBI\u2019s search of Mar-a-Lago \u2014 with yet another assist from the mainstream media for their lack of skepticism \u2014 simply doesn\u2019t pass the smell test. \u00a0     \n      A gas station attendant fills up a customer's tank (Megan Myers/Fox News Digital)\n       (Fox News) The liberal media also want the rest of us to feel better about gas prices \"dropping\" to $3.85 per gallon on average even though it cost just $2.39 for a gallon of gas when Trump left office just 19 months ago. They\u2019re also working to obscure America\u2019s $30 trillion national debt, the Dow Jones being down more than 3,000 points over the past year, and the fact that Biden and the Democrats have wasted $3.8 trillion on big government programming like the ridiculously branded Inflation Reduction Act, just to have inflation remain at nearly a 40-year high. Government planners are undoubtedly colluding with their allies in the corporate media as we speak about how to spin the next Consumer Price Index report that\u2019s coming down the pike on September 13. \u00a0 When Trump supporters criticize Biden \u2014 legitimately \u2014 for all of the above, he smears 74 million of us as \"semi-fascists.\" Most unfortunately, America has become a far-more divided place under Biden because of rhetoric just like this. When you consider that unifying the country was one of Biden\u2019s central campaign pledges, the mainstream media have completely dropped the ball for not aggressively calling the president out on this stunning broken promise. This stark \"about face\" in tone amounts to an enormous missed opportunity that could have been the most important part of this president\u2019s legacy. Instead, Biden\u2019s decision to \"go low\" is hurting the health of the union at the worst possible time. Democrats must pay a heavy price at the ballot box for spinning the lie that they were the adults in the room who would lower the temperature. \u00a0 But Biden and the Democrats are on the hook for far more than that. They must be removed from power for the defund police movement that brought us violent crime in our streets, the subsequent police shortages, and their cashless bail disaster. Democrats must also be held accountable for the open-border policy they\u2019re carrying out and everything that\u2019s come along with it. We must never overlook the record number of illegal border crossings, the deadly fentanyl that\u2019s killing our kids, or the unacceptable human trafficking that\u2019s occurring on Biden\u2019s watch.

This year, generic ballot polling currently has the GOP with a one-point advantage.

Those emails show that Hunter and his former business partner, Eric Schwerin, helped Marvin Lang, the managing director of Guardian Realty in Maryland, plan a dinner with the Chinese Embassy\u2019s minister, Deng Hongbo, on April 28, 2011, which was later touted on China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs website. Planning for the event appears to have started in December 2010 after Lang, who has  donated tens of thousands of dollars  to Democrats, emailed Hunter thanking him for meeting him for lunch and saying he was \"excited\" to form a \"long relationship\" with Rosemont, Hunter and Schwerin\u2019s now-defunct investment firm. Guardian bills itself as a \"fully integrated real estate investment company that develops, redevelops, acquires, manages, operates, and owns a portfolio A-/B+ commercial office space,\" according to their website.

Sounds like this is the right contact though.\"     \n      Eric Schwerin, who was formerly Hunter Biden's business partner, told Marvin Lang in a January 2011 email that a \"number three official\" at the Chinese Embassy would be \"helpful\" in helping Lang secure the Chinese Embassy for a dinner for his company.\n       (Fox News Digital) Based on emails and news articles reviewed by Fox News Digital, the lunch that Schwerin is referring to in the email was the luncheon that then-Vice President Biden and then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton  hosted for Hu Jintao , China\u2019s president at the time, in the State Department\u2019s Benjamin Franklin Room on Jan. 19, 2011. One of the emails that Schwerin sent to Hunter late at night the night before the luncheon said that Hunter was sitting at the same table as Ron Klain, who was the chief of staff for Vice President Biden until the end of January 2011 and is currently Biden's chief of staff.     \n      Eric Schwerin, Hunter Biden's business partner at the time, informed Hunter in a January 2011 email that he would be seated at the same table as the \"#3 at the [Chinese] Embassy\" and said the official would be \"the guy to ask for Guardian.\"\n       (Fox News Digital)     \n      Eric Schwerin, Hunter Biden's business partner at the time, informed Hunter in a January 2011 email that Vice President Biden would be at the \"head table\" with JK, which appears to be John Kerry, and then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.\n       (Fox News Digital) JOE BIDEN MET WITH AT LEAST 14 OF HUNTER\u2019S BUSINESS ASSOCIATES WHILE VICE PRESIDENT On Jan. 28, 2011, Zhou Jingxing, counselor and deputy director at the Chinese Embassy, responded to Hunter Biden\u2019s email regarding his correspondence with \"Minister Yang,\" which appears to be referring to  Yang Jiechi , who served as foreign minister from 2007 until 2013. Jiechi, who has been a member of the Chinese Communist Party since 1971, was elevated in 2017 to the Politburo, making him among the most influential and powerful officials in all of China. The Chinese Embassy did not respond to multiple Fox News Digital requests for comment on this. \"Minister Yang asked me to follow up with you directly. You will be receiving a formal request from Guardian's Chairman, Marvin Lang, shortly but I wanted to put\u00a0forward some dates that work on their end: May 5, 12, or 19,\" Hunter Biden wrote. \"We look forward to working with you and thank you for your help and consideration.\"     \n      In January 2011, Hunter Biden emailed multiple Chinese Embassy officials about securing the embassy for a dinner on behalf of Guardian Realty.\n       (Fox News Digital) Jingxing said they would \"check with the Embassy logistics to see if the dining room is available on your proposed dates.\" In February, Lang started expressing concerns that the Chinese Embassy hadn\u2019t yet confirmed a date. \"We really need the approval for dinner in writing,\" he would write to Schwerin. Schwerin emailed Hunter on Feb. 28, 2011, saying Guardian Realty was getting \"nervous\" that the Chinese would back out at the last minute and was requesting a written confirmation letter. Schwerin asked Hunter if people at the Turkish Embassy were \"nice\" in case the dinner had to be moved there. Hunter warned Schwerin that Lang\u2019s insistence on obtaining a confirmation letter was \"running the risk of seriously offending the Chinese.\"     \n      In February 2011, Hunter Biden warned Eric Schwerin that Marvin Lang\u2019s insistence on obtaining a confirmation letter for his dinner at the Chinese Embassy was \"running the risk of seriously offending the Chinese.\"\n       (Fox News Digital) Schwerin later assured Lang in early March 2011 that Hunter had confirmed the dinner with the embassy and that \"we should be good going forward.\" \"After our call yesterday, Hunter reached out to Minister Yang and Counselor Zhou and thanked them both for arranging the dinner, said he was looking forward to seeing them both at the dinner and reiterating our interest in having the Ambassador there,\" Schwerin wrote. \"It should have been clear how important this was to Hunter and Guardian, so we should be good going forward.\"     \n      In March 2011, Eric Schwerin later assured Marvin Lang that Hunter had confirmed the dinner with the embassy and that \"we should be good going forward.\"\n       (Fox News Digital) HUNTER BIDEN'S FOREIGN BUSINESS DEALINGS: 4 COUNTRIES WITH FINANCIAL LINKS TO PRESIDENT'S SON The email correspondence then pivoted to discussing possible guest speakers for the event, when Schwerin repeatedly mentioned former Democratic Sen. Ted Kaufman, a longtime friend and adviser to President Joe Biden dating back to the 1970s. In an email to Lang and Guardian Realty on March 10, 2011, Schwerin officially pitched Kaufman as \"an ideal speaker\" for the April event. \"As you may know, Sen. Kaufman (D-DE), was appointed Senator to fill VP Biden's seat in 2008 and served as then Senator Biden's Chief of Staff for nineteen years,\" Schwerin wrote in the email, which was cc\u2019d to Hunter. \"He's obviously someone we know well and wouldn't recommend him if we didn't think your investors would find him interesting.\"     \n      In a March 2011 email to Marvin Lang and Guardian Realty, Eric Schwerin officially pitched Ted Kaufman as \"an ideal speaker\" for the April 28 event.\n       (Fox News Digital) In April, Schwerin organized a meeting between Lang and Kaufman at a Starbucks in Washington, D.C.   On April 15, 2011, Lang confirmed he met with Kaufman in an email to Schwerin, writing, \"Met the Senator yesterday. He is terrific. \u2026 Please don\u2019t forget to send some \u2018words\u2019 of thanks for us to say at the Chinese dinner.\" On April 26, 2011, Lang sent an email to Hunter saying Deng had requested to meet with Hunter for half an hour at the Chinese Embassy prior to the dinner. However, a day later, Lang informed Hunter that the \"DCM and Minister Deng has to cancel his 5:40 pm meeting\" prior to the dinner and thanked Hunter for his \"flexibility.\" On April 29, 2011, one day after the dinner, Schwerin forwarded Hunter an email he received from Lang praising Kaufman as \"terrific and very interesting.\" \"As you could tell, there were a lot of questions from our investors. Last night was very exciting and we appreciated Hunter\u2019s involvement. He is very talented and approachable, which is a nice quality.

It was a terrific evening.\" \"Senator Kaufman was excellent, smart, friendly and very understanding of the political process,\" Lang added. \"Plus, he is nice, considerate man and deeply cares for your family. Thank you again for suggesting the Senator as a guest speaker.\" Kaufman denied that he spoke at the Chinese Embassy following publication. \"I believe that the best answer to what they were talking about is a Guaranty[sic] Realty event I spoke to at the Fairfax Hotel in Washington DC on April 29 2011 at 10:30 AM,\" Kaufman told Fox News Digital in a Saturday morning email. \"To reiterate \u2013 I was not in Washington DC on April 28, 2011 And I have never spoken at the Chinese Embassy.\" Lang and Kaufman haven't been implicated in any professional or criminal misconduct.     \n      On May 1, 2011, three days after the Chinese Embassy dinner, Marvin Lang thanked Hunter Biden in an email for his \"guidance and assistance in facilitating\" the dinner.\n       (Fox News Digital) Two days later, Schwerin sent an email to Hunter with the subject line, \"Marvin is happy,\" and a screenshot from China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs website about the Guardian Realty event. \"Minister Deng briefed his guests on the current state of China-US relations as well as the opportunities and issues of China-US business cooperation,\"  the ministry\u2019s website reads . \"Minister Deng also had an exchange with the US side on how to strengthen the mutually beneficial and win-win economic and trade relations and enhance mutual trust and understanding between China and the United States.

Trust is truly local, in the communications employees receive from their co-workers, CEOs, and companies.\u00a0 The workplace  has become the island of civility. More than half believe that their employers are doing well at keeping partisan politics out of the workplace, an improvement of four points globally since September 2021 and 10 points in the U.S. Employees are more comfortable debating societal issues with co-workers than neighbors, and they view the workplace as their most important community after friends and family. They trust their co-workers and direct managers to do what\u2019s right (79 percent and 77 percent respectively), followed closely by \"My CEO\" and \"My CHRO\" (both 69 percent).

Here are five key steps they can take: 1. Demonstrate trust in employees to earn their trust in return. Those employees who feel trusted by their CEO exhibit twice as much trust in their employer (92 percent vs. 46 percent). That trust is rewarded by greater loyalty, engagement, willingness to recommend, and commitment to excellence. 2. Be the trustworthy source of information. Communications from \"My Employer\" are the most believable source of media (63 percent), nearly 10 points ahead of mainstream media (54 percent) and nearly double the believability of social media (36 percent). 3. Leverage the localization of trust: Source credibility depends on the audience within the organization.

NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!\n   President Biden did not mention his recent student loan handout during his last four speeches while hitting the campaign trail for the Democratic Party as they gear up for  the midterm elections  this fall, raising questions about whether the White House initiative is popular with the majority of American voters. Biden's student loan handout would pass $10,000 in student debt for low- to mid-income households and up to $20,000 for Pell Grant recipients onto the average American taxpayer. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget projected the handout could cost Americans $600 billion. After the initial announcement, the student loan handout appeared to be a win for  the Democratic Party , but Biden has avoided the subject in his last four speeches geared toward firing up the Democratic base going into the final months of the 2022 midterm elections. While the plan could energize support for Democrats among young voters, some of whom will directly benefit from the money, it has been criticized as a handout for the professional class and unfair to all those who have paid back loans in the past. The population that is not directly benefiting from the handout, specifically voters older than 50, may question the fairness and constitutionality of the action.

The GOP views the strategy as an attempt to shift the focus from unpopular policies.     \n      President Biden traveled to Pennsylvania last week to speak to voters in the state.\n       (Susan Walsh) \" Joe Biden bailed out  wealthy college grads, yet is shy to mention it.

{"title": "Rep. Katie Porter under scrutiny for keeping university housing deal while serving in US House", "byline": "Associated Press", "time": " September 8, 2022 4:05pm EDT", "content": "  close             Video   Fox News Flash top headlines for September 8   Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!\n   In  Orange County, California , where the typical house sells for $1 million, Rep. Katie Porter\u2019s four-bedroom, three-bath residence in a leafy subdivision on the University of California Irvine campus is a bargain. The progressive Democrat and law professor, who has lamented the  cost of housing  in her district, purchased it in 2011 for $523,000, a below-market price secured through a program the university uses to lure academics who couldn\u2019t otherwise afford to live in the affluent area. The only eligibility requirement was that she continue working for the school. ALABAMA TRADE SCHOOL OFFERS STUDENTS AN ASSOCIATE'S DEGREE AND A CHANCE AT HOME OWNERSHIP For Porter, this version of subsidized housing has outlasted her time in the classroom, extending nearly four years after she took unpaid leave from her $258,000-a-year teaching job to serve in the U.S. House. But the ties go deeper, with at least one law school administrator, who was also a donor to her campaign, helping secure extensions of her tenure while she remained in Congress, according to university emails obtained by The Associated Press.     \n      Pictured: Rep. Katie Porter, D-Calif., speaks on gun violence during a House Committee on Oversight and Reform hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington on June 8, 2022.\n       (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik) That has allowed Porter, a rising Democratic star and fundraising powerhouse whose own net worth is valued at as much as $2 million, to retain her home even as her return to the school remains in doubt. Porter's housing situation does not violate U.S. House ethics rules. But it cuts against the profile she has sought to cultivate in Washington as an ardent critic of a political system that allows \"the wealthy and well-connected\" to \"live in one reality while the rest of us live in another,\" as she wrote in an online fundraising solicitation in 2020. It also coincides with a growth in interest in the school's housing program, which has resulted in a years-long waitlist of more than 250 school academics and administrators, as a nationwide housing shortage sends prices for homes outside the on-campus development skyrocketing, university figures from 2021 show. AUSTIN MAN WHO WAS ONCE HOMELESS MAPS CAMPS SPRINGING UP AROUND THE CITY, BRINGING LIGHT TO CRISIS Whether voters care will be tested in November when Porter, who has amassed a $19.8 million campaign fund, seeks a third term to the once reliably Republican district that has become more competitive in recent years. \"It sounds like the sort of insider deal that really makes people mad at Congress,\" said Bradley A. Smith, a professor at Capital University Law School in Columbus, Ohio, and a Republican former member of the Federal Election Commission was appointed by Bill Clinton. In an interview, Porter declined to say whether her housing arrangement was appropriate. But she said she \"followed the applicable ( University of California ) policies, as well as all applicable state and federal law.\" \"I am always happy to be transparent with voters,\" Porter said. \"I take a lot of pride in my record on transparency and good governance and have been asked about this before by voters and have always been happy to give them full and complete information.\" Smith said the arrangement could run afoul of an FEC prohibition on third parties paying the living expenses of federal candidates. He cautioned, however, that the situation was nuanced and unique. IRELAND HOUSING CRISIS CAUSES HUNDREDS TO LINE UP AROUND BLOCK FOR HOURS TO VIEW APARTMENTS \"Let's suppose they were paying her mortgage? I think that would pretty clearly be a problem,\" Smith said. \"Here, it is a little different than that. They are just letting her keep a deal that she had previously. But it does seem to subsidize her income. If I were still serving on the commission and that complaint came in, I\u2019d be very interested in seeing her response.\" Porter said Smith's analysis \"is interesting to think about\" and his question about whether the prohibition could apply to her situation \"is exactly right.\" But she added,\" I don\u2019t think he necessarily has all of the facts about how the housing is structured to be able to definitively answer that question,\" citing her payment of property taxes, as well as homeownership fees and other expenses. Smith responded that he is \"not sure how the fact that she paid those fees changes anything.\" For decades, the cost of housing in Orange County has soared above the national average. The University of California Irvine\u2019s solution was to build University Hills, their own exclusive academic community, where home values are capped to make them more affordable and favorable mortgage rates are offered to those approved to live there. The pent-up demand to live in University Hills is understandable in light of Irvine's $1.3 million median home price. Houses in the school's subdivision have sold in recent years for about half of their regular market value, according to University of California figures from 2021. The community is a short drive from the Pacific Ocean and Laguna Beach. And the list of amenities includes a network of parks, walking paths, scenic vistas and community pools. It also feeds into some of the most sought-after schools in the area. But for academics and administrators, the trade-off is that they are required to work full-time for the university, with an exception built in for retirees. For those no longer employed by the school, however, an enforcement provision kicks in, which in Porter's case would require her to pay off her mortgage within months. When Porter was recruited, school officials outlined their expectations in a letter informing her that they would sponsor her application to the housing program. \"Your primary duties, of course, will be to serve as a professor of law,\" school officials wrote in the letter, which Porter signed in December 2010. \"It is expected that you will teach two classes ... you will be expected to hold office hours and be available to mentor students.\" Eight years later, after her 2018 election, Porter ceased to fulfill those obligations. Initially, administrators signed off on two separate one-year periods of leave that enabled her to keep her house, documents show. But school officials voiced more concern about the arrangement in the run-up to Porter's 2020 reelection, emails show. \"Is there any fixed limit on the number of years of leave without pay ... One of our administrators mentioned that they seemed to recall a two-year limit,\" law school Vice Dean Chris Whytock wrote in a April 2020 email. He added: \"Some government service may, of course, last for a number of years.\" Whytock, who donated $500 to Porter's campaign in 2018, wrote a memo outlining the case for extending Porter's leave, while suggesting that there are no limits on how long such an arrangement could continue. The plan required the approval of the school's vice provost, which was granted in 2020, according the the emails. Whytock did not respond to an email seeking comment. In a statement, UC Irvine spokesperson Tom Vasich said faculty \"on approved leaves without pay remain UCI employees, and they can maintain their home in University Hills.\" Porter said she intends to win her election, but would resume teaching if she lost. She declined to say whether she would look for housing elsewhere if she won. After the AP interviewed Porter, spokesperson Jordan Wong provided an additional comment, stating the congresswoman \"had no knowledge of Vice Dean Chris Whytock\u2019s role in researching her request for leave\" and \"at no point\" was in contact with him about it. Still, longtime government ethics watchdogs in Washington, including those with favorable opinions of the congresswoman, say it's difficult squaring Porter's housing situation with her crusading rhetoric. \"She has a reputation for being highly ethical and requiring others to live up to that standard,\" said Craig Holman, a lobbyist for the Washington-based government watchdog group Public Citizen. \"Let\u2019s hope she is not running short of her own ethics with the university.\"    "},

NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!\n   As the back-to-school season gets underway, one challenge that  many parents and educators  face each school year is keeping students of all kinds engaged in classroom learning. One pathway to student engagement at the high school level is  career technical education  (CTE). It's what many people still think of as \"vo-tech\" or vocational-technical education. Today, CTE offers a whole world of opportunity, combining the ever-changing demands of today's top industries with the knowledge gained from classroom and on-the-ground training. Tara Troester, a CTE content lead in  Cedar Rapids, Iowa , works with both teachers and industries to create the substance of career tech programs in her area. NJ MOM WORRIES ABOUT BIDEN'S STUDENT LOAN HANDOUT PLAN AT THIS \u2018TIME OF CRAZINESS\u2019 She \"ensures articulation between industry and the classroom\" in her role, she said. \"CTE is, really, every career path \u2014 it is agriculture, construction, business management, education training, finance and more,\" she told Fox News Digital in a phone interview.     \n      Agriculture is just one career path that students can explore in a high school CTE program. \"We have thousands [of students] take our classes,\" said Tara Troester of Cedar Rapids, Iowa.\n       (iStock) High school students  \u2014 and, in some areas of the country, middle school students as well \u2014 can \"explore careers, learn what the job opportunities are and choose course work that aligns with their interests and also what's available in their community,\" she said. \"We have thousands [of students] take our classes, testing out CTE by taking one class. Then we have hundreds on a \u2018pathway\u2019 [of] two or more classes,\" she said. THIS LABOR DAY, A GRATEFUL NOD TO THE LONG-HAUL TRUCKERS WHO KEEP AMERICA MOVING The most popular classes in her local program are health care-related, followed by electrical training classes, Troester said. CTE looks at \"what the high-demand jobs are\" then helps students \"develop those skills,\" she said. They learn \"to navigate and advocate for themselves while becoming critical thinkers and problem solvers.\"     \n      Health care is the most popular pathway in the career-tech Cedar Rapids, Iowa, program, content lead Tara Troester told Fox News Digital.\n       (iStock) The outdated term \"vo-tech\" tends to call forth outdated images, said Troester. What comes to mind for many when they hear that is \"woodshop settings,\" she said, along with a \"hands-on, minds-off\" mentality. \"The confidence to try and the willingness to ask questions are developed before the individual even enters the job market.\"   Today, CTE teachers and professionals are \"changing that narrative,\" she said. \" Great career opportunities  exist in multiple fields, and we help students see what those fields are.\" TEXAS TEACHERS' VIRAL TIKTOK DANCE VIDEOS SHARE POSITIVE CONTENT FOR YOUNG PEOPLE Troester highlighted new areas of growth in her school system\u2019s offerings. Female students are interested in automotive training, for example \u2014 and there are options for differently abled students as well.     \n      \"Students only know what they see \u2014 and if they have not been exposed to a variety of careers, they are limited in their choices,\" said the director of CTE in Bristol, Tennessee.\n       (iStock) Real-world applications to concepts learned in the classroom are a big benefit of CTE, said Troester. For example,  real estate  students help market a home that was built by their fellow construction students. This is something the group has been doing for the last 50 years. \"Businesses that have a diverse employee population are able to meet the needs of their customers. It\u2019s a win-win.\"   The proceeds from the sale of the home then go directly into next year\u2019s build, Troester said. CTE students often  earn college credits , too, by graduating from high school with an associate's degree, often at no extra cost. The larger adult workforce also benefits from CTE programs, she indicated. \"Businesses that have a diverse employee population are able to meet the needs of their customers,\" said Troester. \"It\u2019s a win-win.\"     \n      CTE students are shown building a house in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. The profits from the sale of the home go toward next year's home build.\n       (Dan Lough) The CTE program also helps \"provide some of those skills that we don\u2019t usually learn until we're working our first jobs, such as responsibility and time management,\" Troester said. \"The confidence to try and the willingness to ask questions are developed before the [students] even enter the job market,\" she said. \"They\u2019re used to asking questions, and they take ownership of their learning.\" LATINO LEADER WORKS TO INSTILL \u2018PRIDE AND COMMUNITY\u2019 AS BOOK SERIES SPOTLIGHTS AMERICAN HEROES Deidre Pendley,\u00a0director of career technical education and assistant principal for Tennessee High School in Bristol, Tennessee, said it's important \"not to make assumptions about a student\u2019s interests and aptitude.\" \"When we have kids who have seen pathways and how they can give back, that makes a community stronger. Having a high-skilled population is good for the nation.\"   \"Students only know what they see, and if they have not been exposed to  a variety of careers , they are limited in their choices,\" she told Fox News Digital via email. Her program \"starts career exploration activities as early as elementary school,\" she said. She added that while students \"may not excel in traditional English or math classes, a career inventory, a visit to a local industry or a guest speaker from a local employer\" may help these students to realize that their strengths and interests lie in more hands-on activities or  a technical field .     \n      CTE construction students in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, built this finished home.\n       (Tara Troester) \"In addition to career exploration, the CTE pathway provides relevant high school curriculum and hands-on experiences, industry certifications, early post-secondary opportunities, work-based learning and  pre-apprenticeship programs  \u2014 all designed to provide a seamless pathway to a career,\" she noted. Pendley said that helping students to develop soft skills is \"just as important to prepare them for the workforce as [is] teaching them the technical skills they need for their chosen field.\" \"Our enrollment in CTE courses has grown by 409 students in two years, which is a 33% increase.\"   Today\u2019s employers \"demand that employees come to them with good communication skills, emotional intelligence, a willingness to learn, a positive attitude and an understanding of what it takes to be a consistent, reliable employee,\" she said. Adding that in their area they have \"more than 100 local businesses and industries that host students for job shadowing and even offer paid positions,\" Pendley said, which helps develop those crucial soft skills.

If hired, students can start their employment during the school day with work-based learning classes, said Pendley.     \n      Today, there is more acknowledgment that \"your path is your path \u2014 and that\u2019s OK,\" said Tara Troester, content lead in Cedar Rapids, Iowa.\n       (iStock) \"We offer dual-enrollment and dual-credit CTE opportunities for students who want to pursue a CTE post-secondary degree,\" she said. \"This helps them finish the post-secondary program faster and begin working and earning money in their chosen field.\" Troester of Iowa said that \"signing days\" for employment and apprenticeships in the trades are now celebrated across the nation just as they are \"for athletes.\" \"When adding new programs, we look at the workforce data in our region to determine which programs are needed.\"   Today, there is more acknowledgment of the idea that \"your path is your path \u2014 and that\u2019s OK,\" Troester said.
